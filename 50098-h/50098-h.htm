<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>It was considered by the past and present members of
the 4th Battalion, The London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers),
that some permanent record of the part taken by the
Regiment in the European War should be compiled, and
a War History Committee was formed in February 1920
to consider the preparation of such a record.</p>

<p>At the unanimous request of the Committee Captain
F. Clive Grimwade undertook to write the Regiment's
War History.</p>

<p>The Committee desire to express their keen appreciation
of the manner in which he has overcome the difficulties
of compiling such a History and of his devotion in carrying
out this long and arduous work.</p>

<p>The Committee wish to express their thanks also to
Lieut.-Col. Marchment, to Captains Boutall, Garratt,
Croll and Hetley, and to other officers who have given
Captain Grimwade valuable assistance; to the author's
mother, Mrs Grimwade, for her assistance in arranging
information as to officers' personal services and in
correcting the drafts of the book; and to the Regiment's
Honorary Colonel, Lord Marshall, for facilitating the
publication of the book.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

MOBILISATION&mdash;DEPARTURE OVERSEAS</h2>


<p>Of the London Volunteer Corps the unit now known as
the 4th (City of London) Battalion, The London Regiment
(Royal Fusiliers) is one of the most ancient. Called out
as a Trained Band in 1643 to share in repelling a threatened
Royalist invasion of the City during the Civil Wars, it has
had a practically unbroken history for nearly three
hundred years. After the regular constitution of the
Volunteer Forces in the middle of last century it achieved
some distinction as the 1st Tower Hamlets Rifle Brigade,
and despatched a machine-gun detachment to the fighting
in South Africa in 1900. In 1903 it became affiliated to
The Royal Fusiliers, as the 4th Volunteer Battalion of
that distinguished Regiment. On the reorganisation of
the auxiliary forces in 1908 by Lord Haldane, it acquired
its present designation, which we will abbreviate to the
more convenient title by which it became known in the
Great War, namely, The 4th London Regiment.</p>

<p>Prior to the War the training provided for the Territorial
Force was only such as to furnish the nucleus of
a Second Line Army. Fourteen days in camp each
summer, an easy musketry course, and a few drills at
headquarters could not develop a soldier fit to meet fully
trained troops. That this was recognised by Lord Haldane
is evidenced by the fact that his scheme provided for a
period of six months' training at home for all Territorial
soldiers should war break out, prior to their despatch on
active service.</p>

<p>But they were none the less given a definite rôle in the
defence of the Motherland. Possibly this was not always
realised to the full by all the officers and non-commissioned
officers of the Regiment; but it was unmistakably brought
home to them one evening in February 1914 when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
secret meeting of officers was convened at Headquarters
in Hoxton for the explanation of the scheme of mobilisation
and of the task which the Regiment would be called
upon to execute should war occur.</p>

<p>At that date the scheme of Mobilisation was already
complete. Under it the 1st London Infantry Brigade,
of which the 4th London formed a part, was entrusted
with the supremely important task of guarding the
London and South Western Railway between London and
Southampton during the mobilisation and embarkation
of the Expeditionary Force from the latter port. The
section allotted to the 4th Battalion was the main line
from Waterloo Station to Farnborough (inclusive); the
Alton branch from its junction with the main line near
Brookwood to Bentley Station; and the branch from
the last-named station to Borden Camp. These dispositions
were worked out in the greatest detail, and
arrangements were made for the efficient guarding of all
railway stations, signal boxes, junctions, tunnels and
bridges, and for a system of constant patrolling of the
line.</p>

<p>The Infantry of the Territorial Force not being supplied
during peace time with war scale of transport, ammunition,
etc., provision was made for this necessary equipment to
be drawn on mobilisation, and waggons and horses in
civilian employ were "earmarked" beforehand for this
purpose.</p>

<p>The scheme having been explained, arrangements were
made to detail all guards, patrols, and requisitioning
parties in readiness.</p>

<p>When the war cloud over South-eastern Europe began
to spread in July 1914 and threatened to envelop this
country in the storm, the finishing touches were put to
the scheme at a memorable secret meeting at Headquarters
on the evening of Thursday, 31st July 1914. After that
meeting few who attended it had any doubt as to what
was about to take place.</p>

<p>The annual camp in 1914 for the 1st London Division
(Major-Gen. W. Fry, C.B., C.V.O.) had been arranged
for Sunday, 2nd August, and on that date, this country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
still not having declared its intentions as to the war, the
4th London Regiment entrained for Wareham, in Dorsetshire,
where the camp was to be held, with a strength of
23 officers and about 650 other ranks under Lieut.-Col.
G. P. Botterill.</p>

<p>Camp was reached shortly after noon, but scarcely
had the Battalion marched in when an order was received
recalling it to London. By 2.30 p.m. it was once again
entrained, quivering with excitement and well-nourished
on the journey to town with the most impossible rumours
of gigantic battles, most of which apocryphal happenings
it swallowed with gusto. At 2 a.m. on the 3rd August
the 4th Londons marched into Headquarters, and after a
few hours' rest began to put the wheels of the carefully
assembled machine of mobilisation into motion. All
went without a hitch. Field dressings, identity discs
and small books were issued: separation allowance and
next-of-kin rolls prepared. The "earmarked" horses
and vehicles were collected, and with the aid of these,
ammunition drawn from the Hyde Park Magazine.</p>

<p>Blankets, lanterns and other stores sent up the River
from Woolwich were unloaded and conveyed direct to
the platform at Waterloo Station, ready for issue to the
Battalion on its arrival there. The machine was moving
steadily. During the day the Regimental Colours were
handed over to the Lord Mayor of London for safe
keeping.</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight the 4th London Regiment
entrained at Waterloo in two trains, from which at each
stop the allotted platoons detrained: so that by the
time the end of the sector was reached in the early hours
of the 4th August 1914, the railway was already guarded.
Eighteen hours before the declaration of war the Battalion
was on its war station: a good lead from Territorial
troops to the rest of the country!</p>

<p>The distribution of the Battalion was as follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Battalion Headquarters, Lieut.-Col. G. P. Botterill, Surbiton.</p>

<p>A and B Companies (forming No. 1 Double Company), Headquarters
at Clapham Junction, under Capt. H. J. Duncan-Teape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>C and E Companies (forming No. 2 Double Company), Headquarters
at Woking, under Capt. G. H. M. Vine.</p>

<p>D and F Companies (forming No. 3 Double Company), Headquarters
at North Camp, under Capt. R. J. Jackson.</p>

<p>G and H Companies (forming No. 4 Double Company), Headquarters
at Bentley, under Capt. E. H. Stillwell.</p></div>

<p>The Transport Section returned to Headquarters at
Hoxton to complete the formation of the Battalion
transport on a war footing.</p>

<p>Brigade Headquarters were at Waterloo Station under
command of Brigadier-General the Earl of Lucan. The
Brigade Major was Major R. F. Legge (Leinster Regiment);
and the Staff Captain, Captain Cornelius-Wheeler (3rd
London Regiment, Royal Fusiliers).</p>

<p>On the evening of the same day Lord Grey of Falloden
(then Sir Edward Grey), in the House of Commons, made
his never-to-be-forgotten indictment of the duplicity of
Germany's action in the pre-war negotiations and in her
violation of Belgian neutrality, and the formal declaration
of war followed.</p>

<p>The order for General Mobilisation, which was applicable
to the Territorial Force equally with the Regular
Army, immediately ensued, and orders to report forthwith
were issued to all members of the Battalion who had not
paraded for the summer training two days previously. It
is to the credit of the Battalion that within twelve hours
no member had failed to reply. The N.C.O.'s and men
thus reporting for duty were as quickly as possible despatched
from peace headquarters and reported to their
respective companies on the line.</p>

<p>As the N.C.O.'s and men of the Battalion reported for
duty they were subjected to medical examination, and a
certain number were unfortunately unable to pass fit at
the high standard required during the early days of the
war, so that the strength of the Battalion on the 6th
August was 24 officers and 785 N.C.O.'s and men.</p>

<p>The early days of August on the railway line afforded
unmistakable proof, if such were needed, of the extraordinary
power of the London soldier to adapt himself
to circumstances. Men from offices, factories and docks,
suddenly taken from their occupations and their homes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
settled down to patrols and guards, to cooking their food
and taking responsibility, as to the manner born. All
were swept forward on the high flood of a great enthusiasm,
and buoyed up amid minor discomforts with
intense pride that their country needed them and had
given them a job of work to carry out. This enthusiasm
certainly bid fair at times to show signs of excess of zeal.
But the zeal was tempered with an immense sense of the
dignity of each and every one as a soldier in the 4th
Londons: the days on railway guard thus formed the
basis of the <i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> which is essential to military
success and which in pre-war days it had been difficult,
by the nature of things, to develop. Scattered though
the Battalion was over some 50 miles of railway, disciplinary
trouble of a serious nature was conspicuous by
its absence.</p>

<p>By the middle of August the greater part of the Expeditionary
Force had been embarked to France, but
the Brigade remained at its war station. During the
dark days which ensued, when telegram after telegram
told always of withdrawal before overwhelming forces of
the German Army after the glorious resistance at Mons,
the Battalion continued to guard the railway, and was
busily occupied in recruiting to full strength and in completing
its equipment. The strength of the Battalion
rose steadily and rapidly, and by the end of August 941
N.C.O.'s and men were at duty on the railway line.</p>

<p>The duties on the railway were extremely heavy, and
no training was possible except the rudimentary instructions
of the recruits who were retained at peace headquarters.</p>

<p>On the night of 31st August / 1st September orders
were issued to the Brigade to withdraw from the line
and return to peace headquarters. The move was satisfactorily
completed by 12 noon on the 1st September,
the duties of the Brigade on the railway being taken over
two days later by the 3rd London Infantry Brigade. On
return to headquarters the Commanding Officer informed
the Battalion that the whole Brigade would be despatched
on overseas garrison duty almost immediately, and called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
for volunteers, a call which met with a favourable response
from all ranks.</p>

<p>The two following days were actively occupied with
medical inspections, recruiting to fill the few remaining
vacancies, etc.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 3rd September the Battalion
was paraded for inspection by Major-Gen. W. Fry, C.B.,
C.V.O., commanding 1st London Division, who, in an
address to the troops, announced that the destination of
the Brigade was Malta; and conveyed to the Battalion,
to the great satisfaction of all ranks, the direct assurance
of Earl Kitchener that the Battalion would be retained
in Malta only until it should be passed fit to take the
field. This announcement was received with enthusiasm
as it served to allay the disquieting rumours of the
possibility of the Malta station proving to be a "sidetrack"
for the period of the war.</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight on the 3/4th September 1914,
the Battalion (strength 29 officers and 976 other ranks,
fully armed and equipped) paraded and marched to
Waterloo amid scenes of enthusiasm and excitement in
Hoxton which will probably never be forgotten by those
who witnessed them, and entrained at 3.30 a.m. on the
4th September for Southampton, embarking on arrival in
H.T. <em>Galician</em> (Union Castle Line).</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

THE 1/4TH BATTALION IN MALTA--FORMATION OF THE
2/4TH BATTALION</h2>


<p>Under escort of H.M.S. <em>Amphitrite</em>, and accompanied by
four other transports conveying the remainder of the
1st London Infantry Brigade, the <em>Galician</em>, carrying, in
addition to the 1/4th Londons, two companies of the 1/3rd
Londons and a section of the 1/1st London Field Ambulance,
made a fair passage through the Bay and reached
Gibraltar without mishap. Here the convoy broke up,
and the transports proceeded independently to their
destination.</p>

<p>Nine days of the comparative peace of ship's routine
formed a pleasant interlude for the 1/4th Battalion after
its recent trying duties on the railway line. The passage
to Malta was too short to allow the monotony of ship's
inspections, watches, and roll calls to pall, and the interest
of the troops was constantly quickened by the incidents
of a sea voyage&mdash;all so strange to Londoners whose
horizon hitherto had for the most part hardly extended
beyond Hampstead Heath or Chingford. Occasional
fleeting glimpses of France and Spain, the gambols of a
school of whales, the brilliant hues of the African shore,
and the indescribable blue of the Mediterranean all contributed
to render the Battalion happy and indifferent
to the discomforts of their quarters 'tween decks, where
the heat was certainly trying after the Gates of the
Mediterranean had been passed.</p>

<p>The first glimpse of Malta on the morning of the 13th
September was uninspiring. From the sea no vegetation
can be seen owing to the system whereby the scanty soil
is walled up along the hillsides to prevent it from being
washed away; and the island presents to the passing
voyager an aspect of monotonous drab rock. No time
was allowed for despondency, however, for, with the
pilot on board, the <em>Galician</em> steamed into the Marsamuscetto
Harbour at Valetta where the Battalion could feast
on the riot of colour which unrolled before its eyes.</p>

</div>

<p>The responsibilities of the 1st London Brigade for the
defence of the Fortress of Malta began immediately, for
the day after its arrival the infantry of the regular garrison
left for the front.</p>

<p>In the early hours of the 14th September the 1/4th
Londons disembarked, and being allotted quarters under
canvas in Ghain Tuffieha Camp, was introduced to the
ardours of a sub-tropical summer by undertaking the
longest march it is possible to make in the island&mdash;a very
trying experience indeed.</p>

<p>Ghain Tuffieha is a summer station on the west coast
of the island about eleven miles from Valetta, and is an
important outpost of the main defences of the Fortress.
It lies in a broad, fertile valley known as the Wied Tal
Paules, which traverses the island from east to west, its
eastern limit being the coast at St Paul's Bay. To the
north of this valley lie the Melleha and the Marfa Ridges,
two of the northernmost barriers against invasion. The
coast round these two ranges of hills possesses a considerable
number of sandy landing-places in well-sheltered
bays, which, as they face Sicily at about three hours'
passage from that island, required special guarding at
this period.</p>

<p>The Battalion now settled down seriously to its training,
and it was found necessary to deal with some 250 men
as recruits. These, however, were passed through the
Barrack Square stage of their training as expeditiously
as possible in view of the heavy duties which fell to the
Battalion in guarding the northern coast.</p>

<p>The guards found from the main body of the Battalion
at Ghain Tuffieha were mostly night guards at the landing-places,
at St Paul's Bay on the east coast, and at Ghain
Tuffieha Bay, Karraba Ridge, and Gneina Bay on the
west coast. In addition to these, G and H companies
were immediately despatched on detachment, the former
to Selmun Palace (which commands the promontory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
between the shores of Melleha and St Paul's Bays), the
latter to Melleha (which dominates the head of Melleha
Bay and the Marfa Ridge beyond it). The latter detachment
was subsequently moved down the ridge to the
coast near the head of Melleha Bay. The guards found
by these detached companies were at Cala Mistra Fort
(at the foot of Kalkara Ravine), Ir Razzet tal Blata,
L'Imgiebah, and Ghain Zeituna by the Selmun force;
and at Melleha Bay, Torri L'Ahmar cross roads, and Marfa
Palace by the Melleha force.</p>

<p>The duties of the detached companies were found to
be particularly onerous, and the proportion of N.C.O.'s
and men employed not only on guards, but also on such
necessary duties as signals, look-outs, and water-carrying
fatigues, continuously totalled rather more than a third
of the total strength of the detachments. Arrangements
were therefore made for the relief of the detachment
companies every seven or eight days, and this procedure
was maintained throughout the Battalion's duty on the
island.</p>

<p>The training of the Battalion proceeded smoothly
but under conditions of some difficulty, partly owing to
the number of men constantly engaged in coastal defence
duties, and partly owing to the unfavourable conditions of
terrain. Every square yard of the rocky hillsides which
is covered with soil is devoted to some sort of cultivation
by the thrifty inhabitants, and the walling up of the soil
on the hillsides, which has already been alluded to, converts
every hill into a series of steps, over which manœuvres
are both laborious and painful. In spite of these obstacles,
however, a good deal of useful work was achieved, and the
Battalion rapidly began to take shape as a useful and
well-disciplined unit. There can be no doubt that the
experience gained by all ranks in taking their share in
ordinary garrison duties at so early a stage in their embodied
career proved of infinite value later when the 1/4th
Londons ultimately took their place in the fighting line;
and, moreover, the knowledge that they were subject to
the critical&mdash;and at that period not always sympathetic&mdash;surveillance
of the regular staff of the Fortress provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the strongest possible incentive to all ranks to conduct
themselves with credit to their Regiment and to the
Territorial Force.</p>

<p>Early in October a very thorough course of musketry
instruction under Fortress arrangements was begun, firing
taking place on the Naval ranges of Ghain Tuffieha. The
companies were thus employed as follows:&mdash;2 on detachment,
2 on musketry course, 3 on company training, and
1 finding all the duties at Battalion Headquarters, the
whole being worked on a roster so that each company was
kept for training and detachment purposes at its greatest
possible strength.</p>

<p>During the early days of the Battalion in Malta a
few changes of distribution took place among officers as
follows:</p>

<p>Major R. J. J. Jackson was evacuated to Cottonera
Hospital sick. He unfortunately remained in hospital
until early in December 1914, when he was invalided to
England. Command of F Company was taken by Lieut.
F. C. Grimwade, and the Machine-Gun Section was taken
over by 2/Lieut. T. I. Walker, Lieut. S. Elliott transferring
to E Company. The Battalion was also joined by 2/Lieut.
R. C. Kelly who, however, remained with the unit for a
few weeks only, at the end of which time he was appointed
to the Secret Service, and with this he remained until the
end of the War.</p>

<p>The middle of September, when the Battalion landed
in Malta, found the hot season waning, and although the
temperature remained high for some weeks the full intensity
of the sub-tropical summer was not experienced.
In the early part of October, however, the scirocco, a
warm south-westerly wind which originates in the Sahara,
followed, with all its usual enervating effects, which were
indeed quite as trying as the intense heat of the sun had
been. Towards the end of the same month the wet
season set in in earnest, and from that time until the early
part of December the camping ground at Ghain Tuffieha
was swept by tropical rains and sand storms of considerable
violence, which from time to time caused a certain
amount of material damage and not a little discomfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to the troops. The memory of suddenly having to turn
out and clear blocked drainage trenches and lay on to
straining tent ropes in the&mdash;sometimes&mdash;vain endeavour
to prevent one's temporary home from vanishing into
thin air, and to rescue one's kit from a mud bath, is now
sufficiently remote to be contemplated without acute
distress, but the feelings which these encounters which
the elements evoked at the time were by no means so
calm!</p>

<p>During the worst phase of the Malta climate the
Battalion remained under canvas, and it is of some
interest&mdash;though admittedly of little consolation&mdash;to
remark that no battalion had previously spent the winter
in Malta in other than permanent barracks.</p>

<p>Thanks to the untiring efforts of the Battalion Medical
Officer, Major J. F. F. Parr, the bill of health during these
marked variations of climate remained extraordinarily
clean, and in spite of its exposed situation the Battalion
suffered less from sickness than the others of the Brigade
which were accommodated in modern barracks.</p>

<p>The month of December, however, saw the beginning
of the most delightful season in the island's year. The
temperature was mild but the evenings cool; vegetation
began to spring up with almost startling rapidity, and the
prospect of the island, seen from the tops of the hills,
when looking down on to the terraced fields set in a sea
of the deepest azure, formed a most welcome and delightful
contrast to the sun-baked and drab view which had
greeted the Battalion on its arrival three months earlier.</p>

<p>At the end of November the detachments were redistributed,
the defence duties on the northern coast
being dealt with by one company only, half at Selmun
Palace, which formed its headquarters, the other half at
Melleha Bay. A fresh detachment was formed by the
despatch of another company to Verdala Barracks (in
the Cottonera Lines, the Southern Fortress of Valetta),
for the duty of guarding prisoners of war, notably the
crew of the German raider <em>Emden</em> who had just been
landed on the island.</p>

<p>But for these changes the routine of training proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
with little variation, and it began to be thought by some
that the Battalion would be condemned to continue its
duties in Malta until the end of the War; but on the
22nd December 1914 a warning order was issued that
the Brigade would leave the island at an early date.</p>

<p>On the 23rd the Battalion (less E and F Companies on
detachment), marched to Valetta to be reviewed by His
Excellency the Governor on the Marsa, a sports ground
near the town. The review took place on the following
day and the Battalion returned the same evening, arriving
in camp at 6.30 p.m.</p>

<p>The following Fortress Order was published on the
24th December:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Commander-in-Chief, after having inspected the
units of Lord Lucan's Brigade this morning, desires to
place on record his great satisfaction at the evident
progress made by them to become efficient soldiers of the
King. His Excellency, who fully appreciates the patriotic
sentiments which have caused such a magnificent body of
men to respond to the call of the Empire in this hour of
national danger, has had much pleasure in telegraphing
to Lord Kitchener reporting the high state of efficiency
and fitness which the Brigade has reached. Such a result,
which must have been apparent to everyone who saw
them on parade this morning, could only have been
obtained by the whole-hearted devotion to their Country's
cause of every officer, N.C.O., and man, and the Commander-in-Chief
wishes to congratulate the Earl of Lucan
and the whole of his Brigade on achieving such highly
satisfactory results.</p></div>

<p>No further preparations for departure were made
until after the Christmas festivities, which were rendered
very enjoyable by the arrival of many good things from
home and by special gifts from the Corporation of the
City of London and the Regimental Association, the
latter organisation providing a gift of a pipe and tobacco-box
for every officer, N.C.O., and man. Christmastide
over, however, the Battalion concentrated on its preparations
for leaving the island at short notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 28th December the detachment at Selmun was
withdrawn, its place being taken by a company of the
Malta Militia; that at Verdala being relieved by the 1st
London Regiment, which for the time being was to remain
in the island.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the departure of the 1/4th Battalion overseas the
following officers had been detailed to remain at headquarters
to supervise the formation of a Reserve Battalion:</p>

<div class="center">
<ul>
  <li>Captain E. H. Stillwell.</li>
  <li>Captain W. H. Hamilton.</li>
  <li>Lieutenant H. G. Stanham.</li>
  <li>Lieutenant H. Parkhouse.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>These officers were assisted by a small number of N.C.O.'s
and men of the 1/4th Battalion who had been found
medically unfit to proceed overseas. The intention in
raising the new battalion originally was to provide a unit
to supply reinforcements to the overseas battalion, but,
as will be seen, this intention was subsequently modified
to a large degree.</p>

<p>Recruiting for the new battalion, which was at first
designated the 4th (1st Reserve) Battalion The London
Regiment, and later was known as the 2/4th London
Regiment, proceeded (as indeed for all the formations
then being raised) with unprecedented rapidity, and
within a fortnight over 400 men had been enrolled, while
the ranks continued to be swelled daily by the advent of
fresh recruits.</p>

<p>Colonel Vickers Dunfee, V.D., was appointed with
effect from 6th September 1914 to command the new
battalion with Hon. Lieut. E. V. Wellby (late Lieut.-Col.
4th V.B. The Royal Fusiliers) as Captain and Adjutant.</p>

<p>The available accommodation proving utterly inadequate
for the growing numbers, the 2/4th Battalion
moved on 23rd September, after inspection by the Lord
Mayor, Sir Vansittart Bowater, to quarters under canvas
at Folly Farm, New Barnet. The strength was now 6
officers and 480 other ranks, and steadily increased from
this time until the establishment in all ranks was filled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Training now began in earnest&mdash;so far as the wills of every
officer, N.C.O., and man were concerned&mdash;but under the
most acute practical difficulties, such as were general among
the newly raised formations, owing to the lack of stores
of all kinds, including clothing, arms, and equipment.
Gradually, however, "wooden equivalents" gave place
to rifles, and mufti made its final disappearance from the
parade ground. During the following month the Battalion
moved into winter quarters, occupying as barracks two
vacant houses at Barnet, namely, "Littlegrove" and
"Beech Hill," and also some stabling and out-buildings
at "Oakhill."</p>

<p>The Battalion owes a considerable debt of gratitude
to the owners of these houses and to other local residents,
notably to W. H. Vernon, Esq., and Sir Philip Sassoon,
for their generosity in providing accommodation and
training facilities and for extending hospitality to the
Battalion in various ways, generosity which was also
extended to the 4/4th (Reserve) Battalion when it was
formed in the following year. Facilities for musketry
training were also provided by the Enfield Rifle Club,
who very generously placed their range and the services
as instructors of several of their members at the disposal
of the Battalion.</p>

<p>Training at Barnet continued until 14th December
1914, when, after inspection by Lieut.-Gen. G. H. Moncrieff,
Honorary Colonel of the Regiment, the Battalion, which
had now grown to a strength of 27 officers and 986 other
ranks, joined the Brigade in billets at Maidstone. Here
the Brigade received on the 17th a warning order to
proceed on foreign service at short notice. The necessary
preparation of equipment, medical inspection, inoculation,
etc., was at once put in hand, and the Battalion was
inspected by Major-General W. Fry, C.B., C.V.O., commanding
1st London Division, who addressed the troops.</p>

<p>It was fortunately possible to grant forty-eight
hours' leave to all ranks before departure, destined to
be the last home leave for some nineteen months, and
on 23rd December the Battalion entrained at 10 a.m.
for Southampton, where it embarked on H.T. <em>Avon</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
(Royal Mail Steam Packet Company), the strength on
embarkation being 27 officers and 889 other ranks.</p>

<p>On the 30th December the 1/4th Battalion marched

these would be required for the relieving troops.</p>

<p>The strength of the 1/4th Battalion on leaving the
Island was 24 officers and about 850 other ranks. Major
J. F. F. Parr remained on the Island and took over the
duties of Medical Officer to the 2/4th Battalion, his duties
in the 1/4th Battalion being assumed by Lieutenant
Casey, who had just arrived with the 2/4th Battalion.
In addition Captain R. N. Arthur and Lieut. V. W.
Edwards transferred to the 2/4th Battalion together with
about 85 N.C.O.'s and men who were found medically
unfit for active service. These officers, N.C.O.'s, and men

the last time at Ghain Tuffieha, marched to Valetta and
embarked on the <em>Avon</em>. That afternoon the <em>Avon</em>, conveying
in addition to the 1/4th Battalion the 1/3rd Londons,
put to sea under sealed orders, which were subsequently

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

THE 1/4TH BATTALION IN FRANCE--OPERATIONS AT
NEUVE CHAPELLE</h2>


<p>The Gulf of Lyons has an evil reputation and in January
1915 its achievement did not belie its notoriety. The
<em>Avon</em> was a fine ship of some 12,000 tons but being in
ballast rolled unmercifully for three days; and the smooth
waters of Marseilles harbour, which were reached early on
the morning of the 5th January, were never more heartily
welcome than to the 1/4th Londons.</p>

<p>Disembarkation took place the following afternoon at
about 4 p.m. and the Battalion, after forming up on the
quay, marched straight to the railway siding, where a
train stood in readiness to carry it into the war area. To
British soldiers who have served in the French theatre
of war there is, we imagine, no recollection more vivid
than that conveyed by the words "40 Hommes&mdash;Chevaux
en long!" The fourth class French railway
carriage, which is employed with fine impartiality for the
conveyance of men or horses as occasion demands, is now
too well known to call for lengthy comment; it is a
subject over which we prefer to pass hurriedly! Into
these abominations on wheels the Battalion was inserted
at the standard rate of 40 men to each truck and rations
for two days were issued. After a delay, which seemed
to the troops as interminable as it was certainly inexplicable
to them, the train at about 9.30 p.m. rumbled
sedately out of Marseilles in the leisurely manner of all
troop trains.</p>

<p>Dawn next morning found the train at Avignon where
a five minutes' halt was made. The enthusiastic reception
accorded to the Battalion all along the line by the
French civilians and also by the military was most impressive;
and the obvious satisfaction with which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
arrival of fresh British troops was hailed by one and all
in the Rhone Valley could not fail to impress the dullest
sense with the strength of the common cause which bound
us to our gallant allies.</p>

<p>A "Halte Repas," that is a halt just not long enough
to enable the troops to detrain and cook dinners, was
made at Macon, after which the journey, which resolved
itself practically into a triumphal progress, was resumed.
At one wayside station, the name of which has, unfortunately,
passed from our recollection, a military guard
of honour saluted the arrival of the Battalion, while the
ladies of the district appeared with offerings of milk,
coffee, and bouquets. So great, in fact, was the enthusiasm
that M. le Maire sent for a cask of wine in which
to assert his faith in the Entente Cordiale! Unhappily
the French railway authorities were not stirred by such
intense emotion and the train moved on before the wine
arrived.</p>

<p>By the morning of the 8th the train was skirting
Paris, and that day the first signs of war were reached.
Near Chantilly (the famous French racecourse) reserve
lines of trenches forming the outer ring of the Paris
Defences were passed, while at Creil some buildings
severely damaged by shell fire stood as stern remembrances
of the great retreat three months earlier.</p>

<p>This amusing though very tedious railway journey
terminated at 9 p.m. on the 7th January, when the
Battalion detrained some ten miles south of Boulogne
at Etaples, at that date a small, muddy, and evil-smelling
fishing village. Etaples, which at a later stage of the war
became such an important base camp, with accommodation
for some thirty thousand men and many hospitals, was,
in January 1915, not used as a British military station,
and the 1st London Brigade were the first troops to be
quartered there. Accommodation was provided under
canvas in an exposed situation, and the severity of the
weather, which was intensely cold and windy with
occasional falls of snow, formed a contrast to the sub-tropical
climate in which the Battalion had been basking
ten days previously, which can only evoke surprise at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the comparatively small amount of sickness which
ensued.</p>

<p>The Battalion had, it will be remembered, left its
rifles, equipment, and transport in Malta, and the refitting
and equipment of the troops was taken in hand at once.
The first step was the reorganisation of the Battalion in
four companies, as follows:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>New A Company&mdash;Old A and C Companies;</dt>
    <dd>Captain H. J. Duncan-Teape in command.</dd>
    <dd>Captain W. G. Clark second in command.</dd>

  <dt>New B Company&mdash;Old B and F Companies;</dt>
    <dd>Captain W. Moore in command.</dd>
    <dd>Captain F. C. Grimwade second in command.</dd>

  <dt>New C Company&mdash;Old D and E Companies;</dt>
    <dd>Captain G. H. M. Vine in command.</dd>
    <dd>2/Lieut. W. H. Weathersbee second in command.</dd>

  <dt>New D Company&mdash;Old G and H Companies;</dt>
    <dd>Captain C. R. Saunders in command.</dd>
    <dd>Captain H. P. L. Cart de Lafontaine second in command.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Company Sergeant-Majors were respectively Edwards,
Elsom, Chennels, and Cornwall.</p></div>

<p>In addition to this reorganisation the Battalion was
issued with new rifles of the long charger-loading type,
with four Vickers guns, and with new equipment of the
1914 pattern (webbing); and a refit of clothing and
necessaries was effected. Steps were also taken to dispose
of the surplus baggage and personal belongings acquired
by all ranks in Malta, and to reduce all to the scales of
weight permissible in the field.</p>

<p>Command of the Regimental Transport was assumed
by 2/Lieut. R. L. Herring, who proceeded with his section
to Abbeville, and returned by road with the full war
scale of 1st and 2nd Line Transport and the Battalion
chargers.</p>

<p>These preparations which occupied the Battalion until
the 25th January were interspersed with such training as
the state of the weather permitted, the training being
carried out on the sand dunes north of Etaples. A
warning order was received on the 25th to proceed to
billets near St Omer to join G.H.Q. Reserve.</p>

<p>The following day the Battalion moved by train from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Etaples to St Omer, and thence by march route to the
billeting area which had been allotted to it in two small
straggling villages called Helfaut and Bilques, where it
arrived about midnight. At this point the Battalions of
the 1st London Brigade parted company until once more
reassembled by the formation of the 56th Division a year
later.</p>

<p>Billeting in the early days of the war was not the
simple matter which it became at a later stage. For one
thing, in most villages neither wire beds, cook-houses, nor
ablutions existed for the troops, and the accommodation
of barns and stables had not been tabulated by Town-Majors
ready for the use of billeting officers. All negotiations
for billets had therefore to be conducted by the
billeting officer direct with the communal authorities,
through whom also straw and fuel were drawn.</p>

<p>After a few days in Helfaut and Bilques the Battalion
was driven from its billets by an epidemic of measles
which attacked the civilian inhabitants, and it found fresh
quarters slightly nearer St Omer in a more important
village called Blendecques.</p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons now embarked on a course of very
severe training under the immediate supervision of the
Inspector of Infantry, Brigadier-General Oxley. This
was, indeed, a strenuous three weeks, with breakfasts at
7.30 a.m. and dinners at 5 p.m., the hours between being
occupied in tactical exercises. Usually a march of five
miles in each direction to and from the training ground
was involved and the exercise itself was almost invariably
the "Attack in Open Warfare." In every conceivable
formation, over every conceivable sort of ground, did the
Battalion attack every one of the villages within reach of
Blendecques, till at last it was entirely weary of the attack
in any shape or form! But the grounding in field work
thus obtained was excellent and so completely were the
lessons rubbed into the mind of every member of the
Battalion that this wearisome training bore excellent fruit
as we shall see later.</p>

<p>Once or twice a slight variation of training was obtained
in work on a new reserve line of trenches then being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
constructed east of St Omer. This work was carried out
under R.E. supervision. The design of these trenches
was strange. Their like was indeed never met with in
any sector of the line held by the Battalion in the whole
of its war service, and we can only be thankful that this
reserve line never came into active use.</p>

<p>Throughout the training period the weather was
continuously wet and cold, and these adverse conditions,
added to the long hours without food, imposed a serious
physical strain on all, and the news that the Battalion
had been passed fit to join a brigade was therefore
received by all ranks with extreme satisfaction.</p>

<p>At Blendecques the Battalion was joined by Lieut. A.
Hurd, R.A.M.C., medical officer, vice Captain Casey to
hospital. 2/Lieut. E. W. Bottomley was also evacuated
to hospital.</p>

<p>On the 19th February the 1/4th Londons left the many
good friends they had made in Blendecques and marched
through Wittes, where it halted for the night, to Ham-en-Artois,
arriving at 12.30 p.m. on the 20th, and joined
the Ferozepore Brigade of the Lahore Division.</p>

<p>The Indian Corps (Lieut.-Gen. Sir James Willcocks,
G.C.M.G., K.C.B., K.C.S.I., D.S.O.) had arrived in France
in the preceding October and comprised the 3rd (Lahore)
and 7th (Meerut) Divisions, the former including the
following units:</p>

<p>During the months of December and January the
Indian Corps had been heavily engaged in a local operation
which had raged with terrific intensity between the small
village of Givenchy and the extreme right of our line;
but our struggles to press forward along the canal to
La Bassée had been checked by a particularly vigorous
defence on the part of the enemy. The casualties suffered
by the Brigades of the Indian Corps in the fighting had
been so severe that it was necessary to withdraw some of
them for a time from the line for the purpose of rest and
reorganisation.</p>

<p>On joining its Brigade the strength of the 1/4th Londons
was 25 officers and 828 other ranks. The Battalion was
fortunate in being posted to the Division at this juncture
as it had an opportunity before going into action of
becoming acquainted with its neighbouring battalions
with whom it was destined to share the fortunes of war
during the ensuing eleven months, and of gaining some
insight into the ancient, but at that date recently revived,
sciences of bombing and trench mortar work. And here
let us remark for the benefit of those members of the
Battalion who joined the Service at a later stage and
found Mills Bombs and the Stokes Mortar ready for their
use, that in February 1915 the only bombs in use were
those of the "jam-tin" variety, that is to say, were
roughly constructed out of old tins by the troops who
were to use them, filled with explosives, plugged with clay,
and fused with ordinary time fuse which had to be ignited
before the bomb was thrown; while the trench mortar
of the day is perhaps best described as a glorified rainwater
pipe bound with copper wire, and which threw a
"jam-tin" bomb and was quite as dangerous to the
team which manned it as to the Germans.</p>

<p>With their unfailing adaptability to circumstances the
men of the Battalion rapidly became friends with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Indian troops whom they held in the greatest admiration.
The Gurkhas in particular seemed to exercise an irresistible
attraction for the men of London, who were especially
impressed with the Gurkhas' playful way of throwing
their murderous Kukri knives. Indeed, to such lengths
did this admiration&mdash;which took the form of imitation&mdash;lead
them that a Battalion order was very quickly necessary
to the effect that "the game known as 'Gurkhas'
played with unsheathed bayonets must cease forthwith!"</p>

<p>Throughout this period the weather was intensely cold
and several falls of snow occurred. The billets were
passably good, however, and the Battalion's bill of health
remained clean.</p>

<p>The Battalion was unfortunate at this period in losing
Sergeant-Major Dudley, who had done excellent work
since mobilisation and now left for a commission in the
Royal Fusiliers. He was killed a fortnight after joining
his regiment. His duties were taken by Col.-Sergt. Instr.
M. Harris, who filled this important position with success
for nearly three years.</p>

<p>On the 22nd February the undermentioned officers,
being the first reinforcement received by the Battalion,
joined as follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Lieuts. F. A. Coffin, H. M. Lorden, D. J. Leonard, and A. D.
Coates.</p></div>

<p>It is now necessary for a moment to look at the course
which events were taking on the wide field of the Western
Theatre.</p>

<p>At the period with which we are dealing, the Front
held by the British troops extended from the Béthune-La
Bassée Road, on the right to just north of the Ypres
Salient on the left, and General Headquarters (Field-Marshal
Sir John French in command) were at St Omer.
The British troops were divided into two Armies, of which
the First Army under Sir Douglas Haig, consisting of the
I Corps (Gough), IV Corps (Rawlinson), and Indian Corps
(Willcocks), held the right or southern end of the line; the
left being entrusted to the Second Army (Sir H. Smith-Dorrien),
which comprised the II Corps (Fergusson), the
III Corps (Pulteney), and the V Corps (Plumer).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>The moving warfare of the autumn of 1914, which had
ended by the opposing armies gradually extending their
flanks until the sea was reached and had culminated in
the First Battle of Ypres in October&mdash;November 1914,
had given way to a siege warfare in which the belligerents
were confined in continuous lines of trenches which were
gradually being more heavily fortified. After the force
of the German drive toward Ypres had exhausted itself,
a lull in active operations ensued, hostilities flaring up
here and there along the line in the shape of minor operations
of terrible intensity, in which the possession of a
few yards of ground was contested with ferocity by both
sides. In the intervals between these small struggles,
however, the battle line had been comparatively quiet
during the winter months, and not materially changed,
the nett result being perhaps a slight gain of ground to
the British at the southern end of the line, which was
balanced by a tendency to lose ground in the north.</p>

<p>Since the bitter struggle at Ypres in November 1914,
the enemy had, in the opinion of Sir John French, shown
certain signs of weakening on the Western Front, and
this was attributed by him to the success which was
attending the Russian offensive in East Prussia, and to
the consequent withdrawal of German troops from the
West. In order to assist our Russian Allies as far as
possible it was necessary to have resort to active operations
with the main object of holding as many of the
German reserves as possible in the West, and efforts to
this end were already being made by the French at Arras
and in Champagne.</p>

<p>The ravages caused during the winter trench warfare
by sickness and "trench-foot," which had had especially
disastrous effects on those regular divisions composed of
troops withdrawn from tropical garrisons, rendered necessary
the early cultivation of a vigorous offensive spirit,
and these combined considerations led Sir John French
to the decision to take the offensive as soon as the condition
of the ground in Flanders should afford such an
undertaking a reasonable prospect of success. By the
beginning of March the conditions were considered suffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>ciently
favourable, and the terrain selected for the proposed
offensive was the German positions opposed to the First
Army and defending the lower slopes of the Aubers
Ridge.</p>

<p>The objective of the First Army's attack was the
advancement of our line to the high ground about Illies and
Hermies as a prelude to the occupation of La Bassée,
and this involved as a first local objective the capture
of the village of Neuve Chapelle. The Aubers Ridge is
a strongly marked hill feature, which runs in a south-westerly
direction from Lille until it loses itself in the
marshlands in the neighbourhood of La Bassée. Neuve
Chapelle, which had already changed hands several times
in the fighting of the previous autumn, is a small village,
the immediate surroundings of which are much intersected
with orchards and fences, about 1000 yards from the lowest
slopes of the Ridge, which, immediately opposite to it,
are covered by a considerable wood called the Bois du
Biez.</p>

<p>The German defensive position skirted in front (or
to the north-west) of Neuve Chapelle and then making a
sharp turn southwards, followed the line of the Estaires-La
Bassée Road, for some 600 yards, from its junction
with Foresters Lane (Rue des Berceaux) to its junction
with the Rue du Bois, where once more turning slightly
to the west it left the hamlet of Richebourg L'Avoué in
the British lines, and finally made a wide sweep once
more to the south in the direction of Festubert (see Map
No. 1). The front of attack allotted to the Indian Corps
was that part which followed the alignment of the La Bassée
road between Rue du Bois and Foresters Lane, the actual
capture of the greater part of Neuve Chapelle being
entrusted to the 8th Division.</p>

<p>The attack was to be preceded by a heavy artillery
bombardment, which on the Corps front would be conducted
by the divisional artillery of both the Lahore and
Meerut Divisions and the Corps heavy artillery, and this
was to be directed towards destroying the enemy's front
trenches and entanglements and certain strong posts,
the searching of the Bois du Biez, in order to disperse the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
concentration of the enemy's counter-attack troops, and
finally the building up of a "curtain of fire" (subsequently
though less descriptively termed a "barrage") east of
the captured positions, with the object of assisting the
work of consolidating them.</p>

<p>The direction of the Indian Corps' attack being almost
easterly converged towards that of the IV Corps on their
left (this being south-easterly), and it was, therefore,
necessary after the first German positions had been
carried and touch with the IV Corps secured, to swing the
direction of attack round more to the south, and to
establish a fire position facing south in order to guard
against the danger of a German flanking counter-attack
from that quarter. The position selected for this was a
German sap, which had been thrown out from the enemy
lines towards the British strong point, Port Arthur, at
the corner of La Bassée Road and Rue du Bois.</p>

<p>The troops holding the line of the Rue du Bois front,
outside the limit of the general attack, would thus be
responsible for the defence of the Indian right flank. It
was hoped that the first bound would carry our line
forward to the old II Corps line first occupied by Smith-Dorrien's
troops in October 1914, east of Neuve Chapelle
village.</p>

<p>The assaulting troops detailed for this task were the
Gharwal and Dehra Dun Brigades of the Meerut Division,
the Bareilly Brigade being in close support; while the
Lahore Division (less artillery) was placed in Corps reserve,
the Ferozepore Brigade being allotted to Army Reserve.</p>

<p>In accordance with these orders the Ferozepore Brigade
moved forward from Ham-en-Artois to the Zelobes area
on the 7th March, the 4th Londons marching to Calonne-sur-Lys
about eight miles north-west of Neuve Chapelle,
where it remained in billets in a constant state of readiness
to move. On the eve of the outbreak of our offensive
the order was relaxed to one of readiness to move at
twelve hours' notice.</p>

<p>On the 10th March Lieut.-Col. Botterill was granted
seven days' leave of absence on urgent private affairs,
and command of the Battalion devolved temporarily on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Major L. T. Burnett, who remained in command until
after the termination of the Neuve Chapelle operations.</p>

<p>In addition to the Brigades of the Meerut Division
already mentioned, on the right of the line, the troops
detailed for the assault comprised the 25th Brigade of the
8th Division opposite Neuve Chapelle village, with the
23rd Brigade of the same Division on the extreme left.</p>

<p>An enormous concentration of artillery had been
quietly effected on this front, including many of our newly
arrived heavy batteries, and at 7.30 a.m. on the 10th March,
some 300 guns opened a devastating bombardment on
the German trenches along the frontage of attack. The
severity of this bombardment was unprecedented.
Trenches were obliterated, machine-guns and Germans
were literally blown into the air, and so dazed were the
enemy by the appalling ordeal that our men were able
to stand on their parapets to watch the inferno in front
of them. At 8.5 a.m. the range of the guns was lengthened
on to the enemy's support trenches and our assaulting
columns dashed forward. The Indians and the 25th
Brigade met with little resistance, but the 23rd Brigade
on the left found itself faced with a practically unbroken
wire entanglement, from beyond which a deadly fire was
poured into it by the enemy machine-guns. By 8.35 a.m.
the right and centre brigades had effected a lodgment in
the village, but the 23rd, being still held up and suffering
terrible losses, the 25th Brigade swung to its left and
turned the flank of the German troops who were opposing
the 23rd. By this means our left was able to advance
and by 11 a.m. the village of Neuve Chapelle was completely
in our hands, and consolidation of the ground
won was begun under cover of our artillery barrage, which
effectually carried out its task of preventing the enemy
bringing forward reinforcements for a counter-attack.</p>

<p>The street fighting, however, had resulted in considerable
disorganisation of units, so that valuable hours
were lost in the necessary reorganisation, and it was not
until 3.30 p.m. that the advance could be resumed. The
attack so far had proved&mdash;as was intended&mdash;a complete
surprise, and the enemy's resistance seems to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
paralysed except on the extreme left where our troops
were still under heavy fire.</p>

<p>The only local counter-attack which developed during
the morning of the 10th was on the extreme right of the
attack, where the enemy succeeded along the Rue du Bois
in temporarily ejecting the Indian troops from the
captured trenches, and in effecting a strong lodgment in
the Orchard Trench in front of Richebourg L'Avoué.
During the morning the Jullundur and Sirhind Brigades
moved forward to Richebourg St Vaast and Vieille
Chapelle respectively.</p>

<p>The afternoon advance was made on the right by the
Dehra Dun Brigade, supported by the Jullundur Brigade
of the Lahore Division, and the objective assigned to it
was the Bois du Biez. Between Neuve Chapelle and the
wood runs the little Rivière des Layes, and at a point
where this stream is spanned by a road bridge the enemy
had established a strong machine-gun post. The Indians
made a gallant advance over 1000 yards of open country,
and succeeded in penetrating the wood, but their line
was enfiladed by the machine-guns on the bridge and they
were unable to hold the line of their furthest advance.
On the left the attack was renewed by the 25th and
24th Brigades, the hard-hit 23rd being held back, their
objective being the cluster of houses at Moulin de Pietre,
about a mile east of Neuve Chapelle; but their efforts
also were frustrated by the machine-guns on the bridge,
which our artillery was unable to dislodge. Further left
still the front of attack had been extended and the 21st
Brigade (Watts) of the 7th Division was also directed
on Pietre; but in its advance encountered a line of undamaged
German trenches which effectually barred its
efforts to progress.</p>

<p>The position, therefore, when darkness intervened
was that an average advance of over a thousand yards had
been gained and held, while practically no effort had been
made by the enemy to regain possession of the lost ground.</p>

<p>Preparations were made for a renewal of the advance
on the following day, but the 11th dawned misty and the
day proved to be one of equilibrium. A further advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
was, attempted but the mist rendered aircraft observation
impossible and artillery co-operation with the infantry
extremely difficult owing to the constant breaking of our
forward lines of communication by the enemy shell fire.
Our troops, therefore, clung to their positions opposite
the Bois du Biez and Pietre under a murderous shell fire
which caused many casualties; while the enemy, by a
stroke of ill fortune, was accorded a for him lucky respite,
in which he was able to prepare his counter-attack.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 11th the exhaustion of the troops
after two days' fighting rendered a relief desirable, as it
was hoped that weather conditions would favour a prosecution
of the offensive on the next day. The Meerut
Division consequently handed over its newly won positions
to the Lahore Division, the Dehra Dun Brigade being
replaced by the Sirhind Brigade, while arrangements were
completed for relieving the Gharwal Brigade on the night
of the 12th/13th by the Ferozepore Brigade.</p>

<p>The same evening the 4th London moved at 6 p.m.
from Calonne to Lestrem where it arrived at midnight
and went into billets. Its stay there, however, was short
as within two hours it was turned out in order to move
further forward to Lacouture, about four miles west of
Neuve Chapelle, reaching there about 7.30 a.m. on the
12th March. Similar forward moves were made by the
remainder of the Brigade in view of its impending
occupation of the line.</p>

<p>When the 4th Londons reached Lacouture the village
was under shell fire from the enemy's heavy guns and the
behaviour of all ranks under fire for the first time was
highly commendable. But here also the hopes of rest
on which the thoughts of all had been centred far more than
on the German shells, were dashed, for almost immediately
on arrival the Battalion received fresh orders to move
forward to Richebourg St Vaast, in which village Brigade
headquarters were then operating. The exhaustion of
all ranks on arrival was considerable as the Battalion had
been almost continuously on the move in full marching
order for about eighteen hours. Richebourg was a village
of some importance and a considerable number of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
heavy batteries supporting the Neuve Chapelle attack
were stationed in its vicinity, with the result that it
received a generous share of the enemy's counter-battery
bombardment and also a good deal of attention due,
apparently, to the prominence of its church tower, to the
existence of which the Germans objected.</p>

<p>Here at last the Battalion was allotted billets in which
it remained until about 7 p.m., being under heavy shell
fire the whole time and sustaining its first battle casualties
of seven men wounded.</p>

<p>The mist continued during the 12th and our main
operation could not be pursued. The hostile shell fire
increased in intensity, but the Germans were equally
with ourselves embarrassed by the difficulties of accurate
observation and their bombardments were not very
disastrous to us. Local advances were attempted by
our troops in various parts of the line and the houses
at Pietre were actually reached by the Guards of the
20th Brigade, but the ground gained was heavily swept
by hostile fire and could not be retained. All day counter-attacks
in mass formation were attempted by the Germans,
and costly as the day was to us, our casualties must have
been far exceeded by theirs, their ranks being literally
mown down by our rifle, machine-gun and shrapnel fire.
By dusk the enemy's attempts had exhausted themselves
and for the first time in the war the Germans gave up
attempts to recapture ground they had lost.</p>

<p>As it had been hoped that the 12th would witness the
continuance of our successes it had been impossible to
arrange beforehand the details of the relief of the Gharwal
Brigade by the Ferozepore Brigade until the result of the
intended operations should be known, and it was not,
therefore, until late in the afternoon that the Brigade
received orders to move forward at once in order to take
part in an attack that evening on the Bois du Biez, which
position it was proposed to carry at all costs. For this
operation the 41st Dogras of the Bareilly Brigade, then
in the trenches, were to be lent to the Brigade and relieved
in their position in line by the 4th Londons. This relief,
however, could not be effected in time to enable the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
41st Dogras to join the Ferozepore Brigade, which consequently
advanced short of one battalion.</p>

<p>The Brigade was not assembled in front of Neuve
Chapelle until darkness had fallen, and in order to allow
time for the necessary dispositions to be made, General
Egerton, who for this operation commanded not only the
Ferozepore, but also the Jullundur and Sirhind Brigades,
arranged for the attack to commence at 10.30 p.m. At
9.30 p.m., however, orders were received cancelling the
attack and indicating that the offensive had closed, and
the Brigade returned to billets in Vieille Chapelle and
Lacouture.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the 4th Londons proceeded with the relief
of the 41st Dogras, and although they occupied the line
only for a few hours, perhaps we may be pardoned for a
rather more detailed record of the night's work than the
importance of the operation warrants in view of the
fact that this was the first tour of duty done by the
Battalion in trenches. The sector to be occupied lay at
an interval of about 300 yards from the right limit of the
Neuve Chapelle attack as already described, and consisted
of a frontage of some 400 yards, in front of the Rue du
Bois. The line in this part did not consist of a continuous
line of trenches. In the first place, the ground
here, as for miles in each direction, was too waterlogged
to admit of a trench being dug, and the defences, therefore,
consisted of a breastwork built up above ground
level, and in most parts of this sector the breastwork did
not exceed three feet in height and was entirely without
parados. As a result, moreover, of the recent fighting
the defensive line consisted rather of a series of short
breastworks with gaps between them which could only
be crossed under cover of darkness. Communication
trenches to the rear were non-existent and the breastwork
had to be approached from the Rue du Bois, to which
it ran parallel at a distance of about fifty yards, "overland."
It may be of interest to those who served in this
area with the regiment in the winter of 1916/17 to state
that this feeble breastwork was almost in the position of
the support line subsequently known as Guards' Trench.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_b_032fp.jpg" width="500" height="452" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Neuve Chapelle&mdash;Richebourg l'Avoué</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>This position perhaps was not an ideal one for the
first introduction of a raw Battalion to trench warfare,
and the situation was not improved by the exhaustion of
the men or the fact that the Rue du Bois was subject
to a great deal of heavy shelling which had not died down
since the German counter-attacks of the day, but which
continued through the night. The Battalion moved
forward by platoons past Windy Corner, where it came
under a heavy burst of shrapnel, and Edward Road,
skirting behind the ruined factory at the corner of the
Rue du Bois, and led by Indian guides, whose vague acquaintance
with the language of London did not assist
matters to any appreciable extent. Be it remembered
also that no maps had been issued and no reconnaissance
of the line had been possible to any company officer.
However, the Battalion succeeded in occupying its breastwork
and remained there during the night, somewhat
isolated as touch with the units on its flanks was difficult
to maintain owing to the breaks in the line, and all ranks
acquitted themselves in an exemplary manner. The
shrapnel and machine-gun fire maintained by the Germans
during the night cost a few casualties, amounting to
14 N.C.O.'s and men wounded. In addition to these
was 2/Lieut. A. R. Moore, who was hit in the leg on
the way up to the line. This officer, however, stuck
to his duty and remained with his platoon until after
relief of the Battalion the next morning. He was awarded
the Military Cross for his gallant conduct.</p>

<p>The Ferozepore Brigade attack not having materialised,
the 41st Dogras returned to the trenches, and before daybreak
the 4th Londons were relieved and withdrew to
billets in Vieille Chapelle.</p>

<p>With these incidents ended the battle of Neuve
Chapelle in which, although the gain of ground was much
less than had been hoped for, yet some solid success
had been achieved. Our line had been carried forward
for about 1000 yards on a front of about two miles,
and the prisoners captured amounted to 1650 all ranks.
The British casualties had reached the serious total of
12,811, but the enemy's far exceeded this number. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
outstanding result of the action, however, was an immense
accession of moral strength to the British troops, for it
had been clearly established that where we could meet
the Germans on terms of equality in men and material,
we were able to beat them, and the confirmation of this,
supplied by the battle of Neuve Chapelle, sent a thrill
of triumph in the hearts of our men all along the line.</p>

<p>On the night 13/14 March, the Ferozepore Brigade
relieved the Bareilly Brigade on the Rue du Bois, the
front line being occupied by the 57th Rifles, 129th
Baluchis and 1st Connaught Rangers, the 4th Londons
moving to Richebourg St Vaast in Brigade reserve.</p>

<p>The sector now taken over extended from Chocolat
Menier Corner on the right to Port Arthur on the left,
and during the tour proved to be fairly quiet, except
in the left subsection held by the Connaughts, where two
strong points, Port Arthur and the Orchard Redoubt,
and also the Crescent Trench, a circular trench connecting
them, were daily subjected to heavy bombardments.</p>

<p>The 4th Londons in reserve provided garrisons for
the forward area as follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>D Company (Cart de Lafontaine) to the Orchard Redoubt, which
it held in company with a party of the Connaughts.</p>

<p>One Platoon of each of A, B and C Companies to the left
subsection, under instruction in trench warfare by the
Connaughts.</p>

<p>Two Platoons each of B and C Companies (Moore and Vine) to
Redoubts D5 and D6 respectively. These redoubts were close
to Windy Corner on Forresters Lane, and were subsequently
known as Dogs and Edward Posts.</p>

<p>Machine-Gun Detachment to Port Arthur Keep, and Trench
Mortar Section to the left subsection.</p></div>

<p>The platoons under instruction were relieved every
forty-eight hours in order to ensure that during the tour
of duty the companies were all given a certain amount
of trench experience. The remaining platoons, not for
the moment employed in garrison duty, were billeted with
Battalion Headquarters in Richebourg, and provided
working and carrying parties each night for the line.</p>

<p>The line was still not fully organised after the battle,
and the Crescent Trench was not properly connected either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
to the Orchard on its right or to Port Arthur on the
farther side of the La Bassée Road on its left; and as
the construction of communication trenches in this area
had not yet been seriously undertaken, the various companies
holding those works were isolated during the hours
of daylight, as were also the detached listening posts
pushed forward in front of them into No Man's Land.
There was thus a very considerable amount of trench
work required to bring the defences to a proper state
of organisation and also in the completion of the wire
entanglements in front of the new advanced line, and
the 4th Londons were called upon for heavy duties
in this direction in conjunction with the Sappers and
Miners.</p>

<p>The tower of Richebourg church still proved a great
attraction to the enemy's heavy guns, and the village
was daily subjected to severe shell fire during daytime.
On 21st March it became evident that the Germans were
determined to destroy the church tower, and a steady
bombardment with heavy shells began, which caused
infinite damage to the church itself and the surrounding
houses. During this bombardment a direct hit was
obtained on a billet occupied by a platoon of Highland
Light Infantry, causing casualties of 12 killed and 30
wounded. Later three direct hits were registered on the
church tower, which fell about noon, and this achievement
was followed by a complete cessation of hostile fire, which
indicated sufficiently clearly what the intention of the
bombardment had been.</p>

<p>All ranks of the Battalion were now settling down to
their duties in the trenches, showing great keenness to
increase their value as fighting troops and exhibiting the
greatest steadiness under the numerous heavy bombardments
to which they had been exposed, and it was, therefore,
gratifying to receive a word of appreciation as to
their behaviour from the Divisional Commander during a
visit which he paid to Battalion Headquarters on the 17th.</p>

<p>The Battalion was now again under command of
Lieut.-Col. G. P. Botterill, and Major L. T. Burnett
resumed his duties as second in command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 17th also a further reinforcement of officers
was received as follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Major E. H. Stillwell and 2/Lieuts. E. P. M. Mosely and F. F.
Hunt.</p></div>

<p>The Machine-Gun and Trench Mortar Sections were
now carrying out their full duties in the front trenches,
and did exceedingly good work during this tour, which,
for the latter section, was their first experience of working
their mortars in action. During the bombardment of
the 19th, 2/Lieut. J. T. Sykes, in charge of the trench
mortars, was wounded by shrapnel while "spotting" for
a mortar shoot, and evacuated to hospital.</p>

<p>On the night of the 23/24 March the relief of the
Ferozepore Brigade by the 2nd Brigade began, and the
forward garrisons of the 4th London being withdrawn,
the Battalion on the following evening marched back
to billets at Paradis, a small village near Merville. The
Connaughts were relieved in the line on the following
night, and the Brigade being concentrated in the Paradis
area came into Army Reserve at two hours' notice to
move.</p>

<p>The total casualties sustained by the Battalion during
this tour of trench duty were 17, a very small number
having regard to the severity of the bombardments to
which it had been subjected.</p>

<p>From the 26th March until the 2nd April, Lieut.-Col.
Botterill was in temporary command of the Brigade
during the absence on leave of the Brigadier; and command
of the Battalion for this period was assumed by
Major G. H. M. Vine.</p>

<p>The rest billets at Paradis were retained until the
30th March, the six days being occupied in company
training and route marches, and viewing of arms by the
Brigade Armourer-Sergeant. On the 28th a parade
service was held by Captain Cart de Lafontaine, this
being the first Church Service which the Battalion had
had the opportunity of attending since the middle of
February.</p>

<p>The Battalion was now firm friends with its Indian
comrades whose soldierly qualities it was learning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
appreciate from actual experience. Difficulties of language
formed a barrier to close intercourse, but a sort of war-cry
was evolved which, being exchanged between Indian
and Cockney, formed a guarantee of friendship. A shout
of "Anglais-bon! Indian-bon! Allemand-<span class="smcap">NO BON</span>!!"
exchanged in passing became a frequent form of greeting.</p>

<p>On the night of the 31st March the Brigade returned
to the trenches, relieving the Sirhind Brigade in a sector
north of Neuve Chapelle village, the right boundary of
which was Sign Post Lane, a road running through the
lines in the direction of the Bois du Biez.</p>

<p>The 4th London was again in Brigade Reserve, and
moved from Paradis at 7 a.m. to Les Huit Maisons, where
it remained in temporary billets until dusk when it advanced
to Croix Barbée, Battalion Headquarters occupying
a house at the corner of Loretto and Edward Roads.
This house will be in the recollection of those who served in
this area in 1917 as the site of St Vaast R.E. dump. Here
the Battalion was again under instruction in trench
duties with the Connaughts, who were in the right subsection
of the new Brigade sector, but on this occasion
companies went into the line in turn as a whole, the
companies not actually in trenches occupying reserve
posts at Loretto, Green Barn, and St Vaast.</p>

<p>The right subsection was defended by breastworks and
was immediately facing Pietre, the hamlet which had stood
between our troops and success on the afternoon of the
10th March. It included the peculiar feature of the
Duck's Bill, in regard to which a word of description may
not be out of place. The name Duck's Bill brings to the
minds of most 4th London men the picture of a large
defended mine crater quite close to the German line, and
approached by a defended sap which was generally full
of water. Such it was in the winter of 1916/17, but in the
spring of 1915 the Duck's Bill was a ruined farmhouse
standing on a knoll just in front of the cross-road connecting
Sign Post Lane with Sunken Road. This ruin
was surrounded by a horseshoe trench, the points of the
horseshoe resting on the cross-road, which was barricaded
and connected with the front line by a rough breastwork.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
The defences here were still in an unfinished condition
as the farmhouse was the extreme point of our advance
in this sector in the battle, and the road barricades were
under the continual watch of German snipers in Pietre.
On the night of our entry into this sector the farmhouse
had just been demolished by German incendiary shells
and the ruins were still smouldering.</p>

<p>"A Bosche had been buried," writes Captain Moore,
"in the hastily constructed parapet, face downward, and
with his booted feet sticking into our trench. They were
Bosche boots, so presumably were on Bosche feet, and
every time one passed in the dark one knocked them&mdash;a
truly gruesome spot."</p>

<p>The Duck's Bill farmhouse was finally disposed of
when the mine crater was blown in 1916.</p>

<p>The reserve posts to which the companies in reserve
were detailed were defended keeps forming with others
the Croix Barbée line of defence. The aftermath of the
battle, which had taken the form of such vigorous shelling
by the enemy, now exhausted itself and this tour proved
particularly quiet. The enemy's attention was paid
principally to the roads and communications in rear of
our trenches, but his shelling was sporadic and harmless.</p>

<p>On the 11th April the Battalion moved out of Croix
Barbée, marching at 5 p.m. for Paradis, where it was
joined the following day by the remaining units of the
Brigade, now in Divisional reserve.</p>

<p>Of the rest in Paradis little need be said. The twelve
days were spent in training under company arrangements
and in bathing, completing issues of deficiencies in clothing,
etc. On the 16th and 17th April, however, practice
attacks on trenches were carried out as a brigade exercise,
and although no definite information was, at the time,
conveyed to the units as regards the purpose of the
practice, the exercise was in preparation for the rôle which
the Brigade would be called upon to play during its next
tour in the line. It was, therefore, with the greater
satisfaction that the 4th Londons carried out the exercises
in leading the assaulting columns beside the Connaught
Rangers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>The novitiate of the Battalion was now over, and it
was accepted as being in every way able to do its full
duty as a unit of the Ferozepore Brigade, and the knowledge
that it had "found itself" was in itself the best
possible incentive to all ranks to uphold worthily the
honour of their regiment. The weather was of the most
perfect spring type, and the ground and dykes were once
more in their normal condition for the time of year.
Speculation was rife, therefore, as to the task which was
destined to be set the Brigade on its return to the line.</p>

<p>A warning order was received that the Brigade would
relieve the Dehra Dun Brigade on Saturday, the 26th April,
in a sector in front of Neuve Chapelle village, extending
from the La Bassée Road on the right to Sign Post Lane
on the left. The 4th Londons were to take over the left
centre subsection, the other front line battalions being
the Connaughts, the 9th Bhopals and the 57th Rifles,
with the 129th Baluchis in Brigade reserve. But this
relief was destined not to take place.</p>

<p>During the day disquieting rumours went round&mdash;started
as inexplicably as such rumours always are&mdash;that
things were not well in the north near Ypres:
rumours of heavy fighting, of defeat, and of dastardly
crimes on the part of the enemy. That the incredible
brutality of the Germans was indeed an accomplished fact
all the world now knows, and we must now review the
tremendous happenings in the Ypres salient which caused
the outbreak of a storm destined to rage with ever-increasing
fury for the next three weeks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

THE 1/4TH BATTALION IN THE SECOND BATTLE
OF YPRES, 1915</h2>


<p>Since the exhaustion of the enemy's drive towards Ypres
in November 1914, the Ypres area had not been the
scene of any important operations, although from time to
time fierce struggles had raged here and there for the
possession of points of minor tactical importance. Early
in April 1915 the British lines had been extended slightly
northward, and a sector had been taken over from the
French troops on the left. On the 22nd of that month
the line from Steenstraate (near the Yser Canal) as far
as the Poelcapelle Road east of Langemarck was held by
a Moroccan Division of the French Army. Thence the
line took a south-easterly turn towards the Passchendaele-Becelaere
Road and was occupied by the Canadian
Division. On the right of the Canadians, British divisions
held the trenches which ran east of Zonnebeeke in the
direction of Hooge.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 22nd the French lines were
subjected to a heavy bombardment, following which at
about 5 p.m. our aeroplanes reported that they had seen
thick clouds of yellow smoke issuing from the German
trenches between Langemarck and Bixschoote. These
arose, as is now well known, from poison gas, of which the
effect was so terrible as to render the troops exposed to
it practically incapable of action. The smoke and fumes
at first hid everything from sight, and hundreds of men
were immediately incapacitated. Within an hour the
whole position had to be abandoned with the loss of
fifty guns. This horrible and unlooked-for attack was
so overpowering in its moral effect that our gallant allies
were unable to combat it, and being totally unprovided
with means of defence against so diabolical a contrivance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
were forced&mdash;as indeed any troops would probably have
been under the like conditions&mdash;to abandon their position
without offering resistance. The confusion and moral
effect were doubtless increased by the fact that the
trenches thus attacked were occupied by Africans whose
firm belief in the supernatural rendered it so much the more
difficult for them to withstand this assault.</p>

<p>The immediate result of this gas attack was that the
left flank of the Canadian Division was in the air and
was in imminent danger of being entirely cut off. But
the Canadians stuck to their positions with magnificent
tenacity and during the night repulsed numerous German
attacks. In the disorganisation following the gas attack
the Germans had succeeded in establishing themselves
on the west side of the Yser Canal at Lizerne, thus
threatening to drive a wedge between the Canadians on
the right and the French and Belgian troops on the
left.</p>

<p>By 10 o'clock the next morning the position, though
by no means re-established, was slightly easier, touch
being definitely ensured between the Canadians' left and
the French right, about 800 yards east of the Canal; but
in order to effect this junction so great an extension of the
British lines had been necessary that no reserves were
available for counter-attack. The enemy's artillery fire
was severe all day and the situation was rendered exceptionally
difficult by the loss of so many allied guns in the
gas attack.</p>

<p>It was arranged between Sir John French and General
Foch, who was in command of the French Army on our
left, that the latter should make immediate arrangements
for the recapture of the original French Line, and for this
purpose it was necessary for the British to maintain their
present position without further retirement; but it was
clear that the British troops could not be allowed to
remain in the precarious position held by them during
the last twenty-four hours unless the French attack were
delivered within a reasonable time. In the meantime
such reinforcements as were immediately available from
neighbouring Corps were being rushed up into Ypres to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
strengthen the temporary line between ourselves and
the French.</p>

<p>On the 24th a heavy German attack breached our
lines at St Julien. This might have initiated an extremely
critical situation but for a powerful counter-attack
organised and launched by Brig.-Gen. Hull (afterwards
G.O.C. 56th Division), who, with his own Brigade and
parts of battalions belonging to six different divisions all
new to the ground, was successful in stemming the tide
of the enemy's advance, although attempts to recapture
St Julien were repulsed.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 25th the left flank of the
Canadian division was driven back after two days' magnificent
fighting, and by the evening the allied line north
of Ypres ran practically east and west from the neighbourhood
of Boesinghe on the Canal to the south outskirts of
St Julien. The general tendency of this line was to bow
inwards towards Ypres. The seriousness of the threat to
the whole British position east of Ypres is obvious. It
was now possible for the enemy to shell any point in
our lines from both sides of the salient, while his positions
being about two miles farther to the south than they had
been prior to the gas attack of the 22nd, he was able to
keep the arterial road from Ypres to Zonnebeeke under
continuous and heavy shell fire from guns of all calibres.</p>

<p>During the whole time considerable confusion was
created by the alteration of areas caused by the sudden
relinquishment of the forward positions; and by the fact
that fresh troops on arrival in the Ypres area had at once
to be absorbed into the firing line to prevent the enemy
from exploiting his initial success. This confusion was
heightened by our lack of artillery, which was inadequate
to keep down the heavy German fire, and our casualties
were in consequence continuously heavy. Ypres was
itself kept under very heavy shell fire which vastly increased
the difficulty of maintaining supplies of munitions
and food.</p>

<p>The Lahore Division was ordered on the 23rd April
to move to the Ypres area, and on the morning of the 24th
orders were received by the 1/4th Londons that the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>templated
relief of the Dehra Dun Brigade on the La
Bassée Road would not take place and that the Battalion
would be ready to move&mdash;possibly by train&mdash;at 1.30 p.m.
By 2 p.m. the Battalion had joined in the Ferozepore
Brigade column followed by the first line transport. In
ignorance of its destination, and quite unaware of the
bitter struggle then going on at Ypres, the Battalion
expected to entrain at Merville, and a great many packs
were filled with eatables and comforts for a long train
journey.</p>

<p>However, when Merville, Indian Corps railhead, was
passed it became evident that whatever journey was
before the column would be made on foot. The march
was an exceedingly trying one and was made under
"forced" conditions. The roads were in a bad state
after the winter rains, and a good deal of opening out in
the column was inevitable, so that the five-minute halts
which took place each hour were mostly spent in "closing
up." Hour after hour the column moved on under the
burden of full marching order, now over uneven pavé,
now in deep ruts and thick mud. Merville, Vieux,
Berquin, Strazeele, were passed in succession. Daylight
gave place to dusk and dusk to darkness but still the
column struggled forward. From all battalions stragglers
now began to line the sides of the road, unable after the
physically weakening experience of trench life to keep up
the pace. At last about 10.30 p.m. a long halt was made
just outside Godewaersvelde, a small village at the foot of
the Mont des Cats. Here a rest of some forty minutes
was obtained on the roadside while double lines of guns,
ammunition columns, and transport blocked the road.</p>

<p>Finally at about 10.45 p.m. the Battalion moved
forward into Godewaersvelde, but the village was packed
with troops, and the companies, therefore, had to content
themselves with such shelter as could be found beneath
the parked lorries in the streets.</p>

<p>But the end of the march was not yet. After a hasty
breakfast the Battalion was again on parade before
6 o'clock on the morning of the 25th, and once more
joining the Brigade Column struggled up the steep hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
at Boescheppe, at the top of which another delay was
caused by a cross-current of vehicular traffic. The distress
of the troops was now so evident that orders were
received to lighten packs, and garments of all sorts,
principally gifts of knitted garments sent out from ladies
in England, were left by the roadside. Through Westoutre
and Reninghelst the column marched on to Ouderdom,
where it arrived at about 2.30 p.m. with orders to billet
in huts. Most of the huts were already fully occupied
and the greater part of the 1/4th Londons were compelled
to bivouac in the fields adjoining. Ouderdom is about
seven miles south-west of Ypres, and the object of the
forced march was at last clear. Some little idea of the
storm raging in the salient could be gathered from the
bivouacs, as throughout the afternoon and night the air
vibrated with the continuous thunder of artillery in which
the rapid and sharp rafales of the French "seventy-fives"
away to the north were plainly distinguishable.</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight orders were received that the
Division would be pushed into the firing line that day,
the 26th April, and at dawn the Battalion was once more
formed up. Shovels and picks were issued alternately to
all the troops for the purpose of digging themselves into
such positions as they might be able to gain, and to each
platoon was issued a yellow flag for signalling its location
to the artillery. In these early days of the War no arrangements
were made for the formation of a "battle surplus,"
and consequently the whole available strength of officers
and men prepared to move forward. Packs were now
stacked to relieve the troops of superfluous weight, and at
4.30 a.m. the companies began to move off at five minutes'
intervals.</p>

<p>The exhaustion of the men made progress inevitably
slow. The roads traversed were fortunately not receiving
much attention from the enemy's artillery, though a
steady bombardment of Ypres with shells of the heaviest
calibre was proceeding. By about 9.30 a.m. the Battalion
was concentrated in a field adjoining Outskirt Farm at
La Brique, where it proceeded to dig itself into assembly
trenches (see map No. 3).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Jullundur Brigade had concentrated
farther to the east, between St Jean and Wieltje, while
the Sirhind Brigade in Divisional Reserve had moved
round the south of Ypres to a position north-west of
Potizje.</p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons' position<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> during the hours of
waiting in the morning was behind the crest of the spur
which runs westward from St Jean, past La Brique towards
the Canal, and though out of view from the German trenches
was undoubtedly located by the enemy's Taubes, whose
reconnaissances over our lines were entirely unmolested.
This, combined with the close proximity of the Battalion's
position to several British and French batteries, brought
it a fair share of German shrapnel during the morning,
the shelling being from both the north and south sides of
the salient. Happily but few casualties were sustained.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> It has been thought convenient in the account of this action to
designate buildings and other topographical features by the names by
which they afterwards became generally known, though they were not
in every case so named in April 1915.</p></div>

<p>Below the hillside on which the Battalion lay concealed
and distant something more than half a mile the
gaunt ruins of Ypres stood out clearly in the morning
sunlight, the fast-crumbling tower of its wonderful Cloth
Hall still erect, a silent witness of the tragedy which was
being enacted. All the morning shells were falling into
the town, a steady and merciless bombardment without
the least cessation or abatement. From the centre of
the town dense columns of black smoke rose continuously,
and the crash of explosions and the clatter of falling
débris followed each other without respite. The cross-roads
at which the St Jean road left the town were in
particular a target for the German heavy guns. All the
morning the 50th (Northumberland) Division T.F. was
moving from Ypres along this road to St Julien, and as
each platoon passed the fatal cross-road at the double a
heavy shell fell close by thinning the ranks. It seemed
to every spectator of this horrible yet fascinating sight
that the German artillery fire must surely be directed
from some point within the British lines.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<p>At 12.40 p.m. the Brigade received orders to prepare
to take part in a divisional attack in conjunction with the
French in a due northerly direction, with the object of
relieving the pressure on the left of St Julien and of endeavouring
to push the enemy back. With this attack
the 50th Division would co-operate on the right of the
Lahore Division in an attempt to recapture St Julien
itself.</p>

<p>The Ferozepore Brigade's frontage was on the right
of Boundary Road (the Ypres-Langemarck Road) and
extended as far as English Farm, beyond which the
Jullundur Brigade was responsible as far as Wieltje Farm
on the extreme right, and the general line of assembly
was on the forward slope of the spur some 600 yards
north of La Brique.</p>

<p>The Brigade's advance was led by the Connaught
Rangers on the left, the 57th Rifles in the centre, with
the 129th Baluchis on the right. The 1/4th Londons
were to follow the Connaughts, while the 9th Bhopals
remained in reserve in La Brique.</p>

<p>At 2 o'clock the attack was launched under a heavy
bombardment from all available British and French
batteries, but such was the shortage of ammunition that
this support died down for lack of supplies in about
five minutes, after which the German batteries were free
to search intensively the whole area of the Brigade
advance, causing a good many casualties in the assaulting
columns.</p>

<p>From the line of assembly the ground subsided gently
to a shallow depression running across the direction of
advance, beyond which, at a distance of some 1000 yards
from the crest on the La Brique side, the hill swelled to a
second skyline which impeded further view. Just below
the crest of the further spur an unfenced lane, Buffs
Road, followed the contour running eastwards from
Boundary Road. None of this land was intersected by
trenches, the Allied trenches being several miles ahead
and to the rear of the German positions.</p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons moved from their position of
waiting at about 2.30 p.m., and shaking out into four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
lines of platoons in file with B Company (Moore) on the
left, and A (Duncan-Teape) on the right of the front line,
followed by D (Saunders) and C (Clark). The German
shrapnel was now searching both slopes of the spur pretty
severely and men began to drop, but the Battalion steadily
breasted the rise from which it could overlook the shallow
valley towards Buffs Road. The sight which met their
eyes defies description. The valley was covered with a
ragged crowd of agonised and nerve-racked men, both
Moroccans and Indians, who, having thrown down their
arms and everything which could impede them, were
streaming back from the front trenches suffering the
tortures of poison gas. It was a revolting sight. The
attack had clearly failed and our leading troops were
broken and in retirement. But the men of the 1/4th
Londons were splendid. Without wavering for a single
instant they trudged steadily forward, though indeed
almost completely exhausted, maintaining the intervals
and distances between platoons with the precision of the
parade ground. Never was there a more striking example
of the results of training and discipline. The "attack in
open warfare" which had been so roundly cursed by one
and all in the days of training at Blendecques had indeed
so sunk into the minds of everyone that instinctively the
troops remembering only their orders to "follow the
Connaughts at all costs" carried out under the most
trying ordeal the lessons which had been drilled into them.</p>

<p>The Battalion continued to advance as far as Buffs
Road, where a halt, believed at first to be temporary, was
called. No trench line existed here but the ditch on the
near side of the road had been widened. This was already
filled with the remains of the 2nd K.O.S.B. (who had been
fighting continuously since the action at Hill 60 on the
17th April, and were now reduced to under 100 all ranks)
and by the reserve company of the Connaughts. The
majority of the Battalion were, therefore, unable to
obtain shelter in the ditch, and the digging of a fresh line
some fifteen yards in rear was at once put in hand.</p>

<p>Early in the advance Moore (B Coy.) was hit in the
foot and his company was taken over by Grimwade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Considering the severity of the enemy's shrapnel fire the
advance was made with surprisingly few casualties, and
although owing to the massing of the whole Battalion
on one line of narrow frontage some intermingling of
platoons on halting was inevitable, this was rapidly set
to rights with little difficulty. The enemy's bombardment
soon died away considerably, though for a while he maintained
a steady machine-gun fire sweeping the crest of
the ridge ahead of Buffs Road.</p>

<p>The troops leading the attack had moved forward
steadily at zero hour and had pushed over the crest line
in front of Buffs Road descending the further slope towards
Turco Farm. The front German trench north of the
Farm was reached and occupied, but before the position
was properly established dense yellow clouds of poison
gas issued from the enemy lines and, being gently wafted
by the breeze, bore down on our defenceless troops.
Under the horror of this ordeal the greater part of
the line broke and a general retirement ensued which
affected most severely the French and Indian Battalions,
as already described. About 100 of the Connaughts and
the Manchesters (Sirhind Brigade), however, managed to
cling gallantly to their ground under Major Deacon,
though they were shortly afterwards ejected by a strong
enemy counter-attack which followed the gas cloud.
They eventually succeeded in consolidating a line in the
immediate vicinity of Turco Farm.</p>

<p>Shortly after the 1/4th Londons were established on
Buffs Road Lieut.-Col. Botterill became a casualty, and
Major L. T. Burnett assumed command of the Battalion.
It was decided by Major Burnett that the overcrowding
of the Buffs Road alignment was so great and wasteful
of fire power, quite half the Battalion being unable to get
into position to use their rifles, that a redisposition of
his forces was desirable, and accordingly C and D companies
withdrew to a position in support some 300 yards
in rear of Buffs Road, where they dug themselves in.</p>

<p>During this time the Regimental Aid Post under
Lieut. Hurd, R.A.M.C., was established at Irish Farm
and the Battalion stretcher-bearers under Corpl. Fulford
worked with great coolness in evacuating the wounded
under heavy fire.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>At about 4.30 p.m. orders were received that the
reserve company of the Connaughts was to push forward
and reinforce their two leading companies, supported by
the 1/4th Londons. But, after consultation with Major
Burnett, Major Hamilton of the Connaughts decided that
the severity of the enemy's fire was so great that there
was no reasonable probability of achieving a result commensurate
with the inevitable loss of life, and the orders
for the projected advance were cancelled. An attempt
to reinforce the advanced troops was, however, actually
made at about 7.30 p.m. by the 15th Sikhs and the 1/4th
Gurkhas of the Sirhind Brigade, supported by the 9th
Bhopals. This advance was carried out in good order,
the Indians passing through the 1/4th Londons and disappearing
over the ridge in front under a veritable hail
of fire; but although touch was obtained with the leading
companies of the Connaughts, the position of the German
trenches could not be ascertained in the gathering darkness,
and Lieut.-Col. Hills, who was in charge of the operation,
decided to dig in on the position gained.</p>

<p>In conjunction with Bhopals' attempt an attack was
also delivered by the Turcos of the French Brigade
Moroccaine, who passed over the 1/4th Londons' trench
in the gathering dusk. They were met in the crest line
by a frightful machine-gun fire under which they advanced
steadily, suffering heavy losses. A young French officer
in charge of these Africans filled all who saw him with the
deepest admiration of his coolness. Smoking a cigarette
and lightly swinging a small rattan cane, he stood up on
the sky line with his loose blue cloak thrown negligently
over his shoulders, directing the advance of his men with
all the indifference to danger of which his wonderful
nation is capable. None of these gallant fellows were
seen again.</p>

<p>During the whole of the 26th very good work was done
by 2/Lieut. A. D. Coates, who was employed as <em>liaison</em>
officer between Brigade Headquarters and the advanced
troops. This gallant young officer succeeded several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
times in passing through the enemy's barrage and was
the means of providing Headquarters with valuable
information as to the course of events at Turco Farm.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the 1/4th Londons remained in readiness
for action on Buffs Road, which was shelled heavily at
intervals, especially at about 6 p.m., when the German
shrapnel caused a great many casualties. The enemy's
fire, however, died down after the evening advance by
the Indians had been checked. The night was particularly
quiet, and Sergt.-Major Harris at La Brique was able to
get rations up to the Battalion and issue them.</p>

<p>The 27th April broke grey and cold and the morning
was misty. During the early hours the enemy's artillery
was remarkably inactive and the work of strengthening
the Battalion's position was proceeded with without
molestation by the Germans. The signs of battle were
few indeed and it seemed almost impossible to realise the
critical position of the British troops. The sense of
detachment from the serious events of the preceding
afternoon was enhanced by the unbroken state of the
countryside in the immediate neighbourhood and the
presence of several cows, which by some marvellous chance
had escaped the enemy's shells and continued to graze
lazily in the field in rear of the Battalion's position, as they
had done during the battle on the previous afternoon.</p>

<p>The lull, however, was only the calm which proverbially
precedes the storm, for about noon the enemy's guns
opened with intense violence on the British positions and
the 1/4th Londons received their full share of these hostile
attentions. Fortunately, however, its position behind
the crest secured it from heavy loss.</p>

<p>During this bombardment Major Burnett was ordered
to report to Brigade Headquarters, where he received
orders for an attack to take place in half an hour's time.
When he got back to the Battalion under ten minutes
were left in which to explain the orders to his company
commanders and to make all preparations. The Battalion
was to execute a further advance in a north-easterly
direction on to Oblong Farm, which was given as the
objective. In order to reach the assembly position, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
was necessary for the Battalion to move about 200 yards
to the right flank in order to come up on the right of the
Sirhind Brigade, who, in the early hours of the morning,
had relieved the most advanced troops of the Ferozepore
Brigade.</p>

<p>The hurried nature of the attack precluded any
possibility of reconnaissance of the ground by the officers
and allowed no time for the explanation of the work on
hand to the rank and file. The position of the German
trenches was unknown and the difficulties and obstacles
which might be met with during the advance were entirely
undisclosed.</p>

<p>The movement of the Battalion toward its position
of assembly for this unpromising enterprise was carried
out steadily although with considerable loss. The British
and Canadian artillery, which were co-operating in giving
support to the attack, were again lamentably short of
ammunition, so that an intense bombardment of some
five minutes left them unable to render further assistance.
Thus as the Battalion in moving to its flank came near
the crest of the spur behind which it had hitherto been
concealed from direct observation by the enemy, it became
a very clear target for the hostile artillery, and the German
guns being no longer harassed by our artillery, were able
to pour a devastating fire upon the companies.</p>

<p>The actual "jumping-off" position was the ditch on
the south side of Buffs Road which, at this point, was
bordered by a hedge. The Battalion advanced in two
lines of two companies in open order, each company formed
in three waves, and the leading companies were C (Clark)
on the left and D (Saunders) on the right, followed respectively
by B (Grimwade) and A (Duncan-Teape).
In order to ensure that the waves in each company should
move forward together, it was necessary to collect the
whole of each wave in the ditch before it moved; and
this could only be effected by "feeding" the men along
the ditch in single file, from the western end of the
Battalion's frontage, the hedge in rear being impenetrable.
The result of this slow progress was that the remainder
of the Battalion waiting its turn to go into the ditch was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
compelled to wait on the hill, under a high explosive and
shrapnel fire which was both intense and accurate. The
result needs no description, but under this very trying
ordeal the Battalion was perfectly steady, each platoon
grouped together and waiting its order to move with the
greatest nonchalance.</p>

<p>Before following the actual advance of the 1/4th
Londons it will be convenient to explain the object and
scope of the operation of which it formed part.</p>

<p>During the morning arrangements had been made for
the Lahore Division to co-operate in an attack which
was projected by the French Brigade Moroccaine. The
general direction of the French attack was to be along
the Ypres-Langemarck Road, as on the previous day,
and the Lahore Division was to take all possible advantage
of the French advance to gain ground, but without
committing itself to the attack before the French troops
had secured its left flank. The Lahore Division's attack
was to conform to the French movement but on the east
side of the Langemarck Road; the Sirhind Brigade
occupying the left of the Divisional front next the French
with the Ferozepore Brigade on its right.</p>

<p>The objective of the latter was, as already stated,
Oblong Farm, a moated farmstead some 1700 yards
from starting-point, the attack being led by the 1/4th
Londons on the left and the 9th Bhopals on the right.
The Connaughts followed in support at a distance of 400
yards, while the 57th Rifles and the 129th Baluchis, both
of which regiments had been seriously weakened in the
action of the 26th, were in reserve.</p>

<p>At 12.30 p.m. the leading waves of the two assaulting
battalions moved forward under a continued heavy shell
and machine-gun fire. The ground over which the
advance was to be made was for the first 700 yards an
unenclosed plateau which afforded the enemy good
observation of our movements, and then sloping gently
downwards to a somewhat more enclosed depression
rose beyond it once more towards the objective. The
objective itself was not visible from starting-point, and
it appears probable that in consequence of the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
hurried preparations for the attack, its position was not
fully appreciated by all concerned and thus it was not
recognised. However this may be, it is certain that the
general direction of the attack after crossing Admirals
Road became diverted too much towards the north and
thus some encroachment was made on the frontage for
which the Sirhind Brigade was responsible. This was
probably accentuated by the fact that the position selected
as starting-point lay at an acute angle to the direction of
advance, so that a change of direction was necessary
during the advance itself&mdash;always an operation of great
difficulty.</p>

<p>As far as Admirals Road cover was non-existent. On
topping the crest of the hill the Battalion came under an
exceedingly severe rifle and machine-gun fire, and losses
were consequently heavy. The succeeding waves, however,
pushed on steadily as far as the near edge of the
depression described above, in the vicinity of Hampshire
Farm, when it became clearly impossible to get down
the forward slope of the valley under the raking fire of
the enemy, without incurring frightful losses. Half the
leading companies were already hit, as were also Saunders,
fatally wounded, Grimwade, Stedman, Leonard, and
Coates. It was, therefore, decided by Major Burnett to
hold the line gained and there to reorganise the Battalion
pending the arrival of reinforcements, when it might be
possible to carry the line forward.</p>

<p>A small part of C Company under Clark and of B
Company under Giles, however, were successful in gaining
the bottom of the valley, but finding himself isolated and
further advance impossible without support, Clark, who
assumed command of the composite party, took up a
position to the right of Canadian Farm, where the men
dug themselves in with their entrenching tools and hung
on gallantly under a murderous fire. Splendid service
was rendered by two N.C.O.'s of this party, Sergeant
A. C. Ehren and Lance-Corporal C. Badham, both of B
Company, who passed through the barrage three times
unscathed with messages between Captain Clark and
Battalion Headquarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Excellent work was also done by the Machine-Gun
Section under 2/Lieuts. Walker and Pyper, who skilfully
brought their guns into action on the left of Hampshire
Farm and assisted in no small measure to keep down
the hostile rifle fire from the enemy trenches on the further
side of the valley. Their position, however, was shortly
afterwards discovered, evidently by a Taube, which continued
its reconnaissance over our lines without let or
hindrance, and the section came under heavy shell fire and
was forced to fall back on the main position, with Walker
dangerously wounded, Sergt. Phillips killed, and several
other casualties.</p>

<p>At about 2.30 p.m. the enemy's artillery fire abated
considerably, but by that time the advance of the whole
Division had been definitely checked on an alignment
generally corresponding with that occupied by the 1/4th
Londons, and reports were received that the French also
had failed to gain their objectives.</p>

<p>Later in the evening the French attempted to renew
their offensive, but once more were met with clouds of
poison gas which definitely broke up their attack, and a
report having been received from Col. Savy, the French
Commander, that his losses were so heavy as to preclude
all further attempts, orders were received that the Brigade
would consolidate its position.</p>

<p>During the evening before dusk the Ferozepore Brigade
was again subjected to violent shelling, which inflicted
considerable loss on all battalions. During this later
bombardment Lieut. Coffin was buried by a high explosive
shell.</p>

<p>After darkness fell the 1/4th Londons were withdrawn
from their advanced line to Brigade Reserve in rear of
Cross Roads Farm where they set about digging fresh
trenches. The Connaughts and the Bhopals withdrew to
the line of Admirals Road near Cross Roads Farm, in
which Brigade Headquarters were now established, while
the Rifles and Baluchis took up a position to the rear.</p>

<p>The night passed without incident and with very
little shelling, and the opportunity was taken to collect
the wounded whom it had been impossible to evacuate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
under the heavy fire of the afternoon. 2/Lieut. E. Giles,
who from many volunteers was selected for this work,
set a splendid example of devotion to duty and worked
hard throughout the night in endeavouring to relieve the
sufferings of his men.</p>

<p>The day's losses had been heavy and the gain of
ground nil, but the bearing of the Battalion under somewhat
disheartening circumstances had been worthy of the
highest traditions of regular troops. Something, however,
had been achieved as, in spite of his use of poison gas, the
enemy was no nearer Ypres and our line, though strained
almost to breaking point, was still holding. It appears
indeed that the gallant front shown by the Lahore
Division was successful in deceiving the Germans as
to the extent of our resources, and deterred him from
pressing the advantages he had already gained.</p>

<p>The casualties of the afternoon of the 27th April were
in officers:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Capt. C. R. Saunders and 2/Lieut. A. D. Coates, killed; Lieut.
P. B. K. Stedman, died of wounds; Capt. F. G. Grimwade,
Lieuts. F. A. Coffin and D. J. Leonard, and 2/Lieut. T. I.
Walker, wounded; and in N.C.O.'s and men, 32 killed (including
C. S. M. Chennels), 132 wounded, and 13 missing.</p></div>

<p>During the 28th the 1/4th Londons remained in
position in rear of Cross Roads Farm, and beyond a good
deal of shelling in which gas shell was freely used by the
enemy the day passed without important incident.
Luckily the bombardment this day was not very costly
to the Battalion or, indeed, to the Brigade as a whole.
The Lahore Division was transferred from V Corps to a
special counter-attack force then formed under command
of Gen. Plumer, and it was arranged that the Sirhind
and Ferozepore Brigades should be prepared to co-operate
with an attack contemplated by the French who were
still on our left flank, making such advance as might be
justified by the results achieved by our Allies. The
French attack, however, did not materialise in consequence
of the very heavy losses of the preceding two days
and our Allies confined themselves to artillery action.</p>

<p>During the evening the enemy turned a large number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of guns on to St Jean and in a few hours the work of
destruction, already far advanced, was almost completed.
In the darkness the church was clearly visible in flames,
the windows being lit up by the conflagration within:
before morning the tower had fallen, the roof had collapsed,
and nothing but smouldering ruins remained.</p>

<p>The 29th April found the Ferozepore Brigade still
holding its trenches and orders were again issued to it
to be prepared to co-operate with the French. But
during the morning definite orders were received that
the French attack was postponed, the assault of the
enemy positions being a more formidable proposition
than could be tackled by the Allied troops in their then
exhausted and numerically weak condition.</p>

<p>The German bombardment continued throughout the
29th, and the Battalion remained inactive beyond the
further strengthening of its trenches. It did, however,
have the satisfaction of seeing a Taube brought down
close to its lines by our anti-aircraft guns.</p>

<p>Before daybreak on the 30th, the Ferozepore Brigade
was relieved and marched out of the salient, the 1/4th
Londons proceeding by way of Buffs Road and La Brique
to hutments at Ouderdom. While passing through La
Brique the Battalion was met by a reinforcement of
about fifty N.C.O.'s and men from the 3/4th Battalion
in England, conducted by Major E. H. Stillwell. Accompanying
this draft were 2/Lieuts. L. G. Rix and B. Rivers
Smith.</p>

<p>The roads out of the salient were being very heavily
shelled during the relief, the cross roads at Vlamertinghe
being in particular accurately bombarded with heavy
shrapnel. But Major Burnett was able to save a great
many casualties by varying the route of some platoons.</p>

<p>At about 7.30 a.m. on the same morning the Ferozepore
Brigade moved from the hutments to bivouacs close
by to avoid the effects of the continuous shelling to which
the concentration camp was subjected, but returned to
the huts at night. The day was spent in rest and reorganisation.
The Battalion was undoubtedly a little
shaken after its rough handling and very seriously reduced
in strength. Over 600 rifles had left Ouderdom on the
morning of the 26th, but at the roll call which took place
on return on the 30th only 235 names were answered,
apart from the newly arrived draft which had not been
in action.</p>

<p>The following awards were made for services
rendered:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Capt. W. G. Clark, D.S.O.; Sergt. A. C. Ehren, D.C.M.;

<p>In this, its first serious action, the 1/4th Battalion had
firmly established its reputation by its remarkable steadiness
under unprecedented circumstances, and, though the
price paid was heavy, it had the satisfaction of having
contributed materially to the undying glory of the British
defence of Ypres.</p>

<p>At 7.45 p.m. on the 1st May, the concentration of the
Division being now complete, the Ferozepore Brigade
marched from Ouderdom <em>via</em> Reninghelst, Westoutre, to
Meteren, arriving there at 12.30 a.m. on the 2nd. A rest
was made here until the afternoon when the route was
resumed, Doulieu being reached about 10 p.m. The
march was completed the following evening, when at
about 7 p.m. the Brigade returned to its former billets
in the Paradis area.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

OPERATIONS DURING THE SUMMER OF 1915</h2>


<p>In spite of the severe tax placed on his resources by the
ever-increasing weight of the enemy's assaults at Ypres, and
the consequent difficulty of finding sufficient reserves of men
and material to embark on a new attack on a large scale,
Sir John French decided early in May to adopt the bold
course of launching a fresh offensive at the southern
extremity of the British front. He was led to this resolve
partly by the hope of diverting the enemy's attention
towards the south and thereby easing the pressure
against Ypres, and partly by the desire to assist the
French who were launching an offensive south of the
La Bassée Canal.</p>

<p>The ultimate objective of this new undertaking was
the opening of the road to Lille, and the necessary preliminary
to this was the expulsion of the enemy from
his defences on the Aubers Ridge and the establishment
of the British troops on the La Bassée-Lille Road.</p>

<p>This attack was entrusted to the First Army, whose
operations were divided into two separate zones. In the
north the assault was to be made by the IV Corps at
Rouges Bancs with the object of turning the Aubers
defences from that flank; while farther south the I and
Indian Corps were to secure the line Ligny-le-Grand&mdash;La
Clicqueterie Farm.</p>

<p>The Indian Corps attack was to be carried out by the
Meerut Division&mdash;the Lahore Division still being weak
after its recent fighting in the salient&mdash;on a front from
the right of the Corps sector near Chocolat Menier Corner
to Oxford Road (on the left of La Bassée Road). The
rôle of the Lahore Division, which would occupy the line
in front of Neuve Chapelle with the Jullundur Brigade,
was to support the Meerut Division's attack with artillery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
machine-gun and rifle fire, and particularly to secure the
left flank of the assaulting columns during their advance
by being prepared to operate as occasion might arise
against the Bois du Biez.</p>

<p>The attack was launched on the 9th May at 5.40 a.m.
after a forty minutes' bombardment of the enemy lines
by all available guns.</p>

<p>The assaulting columns advanced with the greatest
valour, but were met by a murderous machine-gun and
rifle fire, under which they were literally mown down.
The survivors struggled on in spite of the frightful losses
they were suffering, but practically none of the 1st or
Meerut Divisions reached the enemy's front trench.
Farther north the 8th Division effected a lodgment in
the enemy's trenches, but after hanging on gallantly
throughout the day were forced at night to return to
their original positions after suffering appalling casualties.
From all along the line came reports of what amounted to
total failure. The surprise effect which had proved so
valuable at Neuve Chapelle in March was wanting this
day, and our artillery had been inadequately supplied
with high explosive shells to enable them to destroy the
German machine-gun emplacements.</p>

<p>Meanwhile reports were received from the French of
some considerable degree of success. On the following
day Sir John French decided not to pursue his offensive
in the north, but to limit his further efforts to the area
south of the La Bassée Road, and accordingly preparations
were made for the resumption of operations on
the 12th.</p>

<p>The Lahore Division had reached the Neuve Chapelle
area after its march back from Ypres on the evening of
the 4th May, the Ferozepore Brigade finding accommodation
in its former billets at Paradis, which it left the
following day for Riez Bailleul.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 8th the Brigade moved forward
to take up its prearranged position of assembly in support
to the Jullundur Brigade.</p>

<p>The position taken up by the 1/4th Londons and the
9th Bhopals was in shallow assembly trenches in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
orchards about the junction of Sign Post Lane with Rue
Tilleloy. These trenches were hastily dug and very
shallow, without either traverses or any sort of shelter;
and it was therefore fortunate that the weather was unusually
warm and fine for the time of year. The
Connaughts and the 57th Rifles occupied the old British
front line (as it had been before the battle of Neuve
Chapelle) astride Sign Post Lane.</p>

<p>During the whole of the 9th, 10th and 11th May the
1/4th London remained in these trenches under continual
heavy shell fire: though owing to the lack of
success with which the main operation had met it was
not called upon to advance.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 11th it was withdrawn with
the rest of the Brigade to billets at Riez Bailleul. On
return to billets great discomfort was caused to all ranks
by the discovery that the billet in which the packs had
been deposited during the three days spent in trenches
had been burnt to the ground, involving the total destruction
of its contents together with a mail from home.
The following day the Indian Corps Commander (Sir
James Willcocks) visited the Battalion and expressed
his deep appreciation of its conduct at Ypres.</p>

<p>The 12th May dawned dull and misty and artillery
observation was exceedingly difficult; and for this and
other causes the renewal of the attack was again postponed
until the 15th. The Meerut Division was again
responsible for the Indian Corps attack. The Lahore
Division adopted a role similar to that which it had
played on the 9th, and the Ferozepore Brigade moved
forward once more on the evening of the 15th May to
its former assembly positions about Sign Post Lane.</p>

<p>In order to endeavour to secure the surprise effect
which had been lacking on the 9th it was decided this
time to deliver the attack at night, and after a preliminary
bombardment the assaulting columns dashed forward
at 11.30 p.m. on the 15th. On the right of the attack
in the region of Festubert and La Quinque Rue considerable
success was achieved by the 7th Division,
and some advance was also made by the 2nd Division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
which was operating on the immediate right of the
Indians.</p>

<p>The Meerut Division, however, was again faced with
a hail of lead from the enemy lines under which it was
impossible to live, and though the troops did all that
men could do, by 4 a.m. on the 16th, after two gallant
efforts, the attempts of the Indians to advance were
definitely checked and the remains of the assaulting
columns were once more back in their original trenches.</p>

<p>From this date onwards operations were confined to
the southern area in the neighbourhood of Festubert, and
though the battle continued to rage until the 25th May,
the Indian Corps was no longer concerned in it beyond
the preparations necessary to enable it to conform to the
advance on its right flank.</p>

<p>During the early part of the month the 1/4th Londons
received further officer reinforcements as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<ul>
  <li>Capt. A. A. N. Haine.</li>
  <li>Lieut. S. G. Monk.</li>
  <li>Lieut. D. C. Cooke.</li>
  <li>2/Lieut. J. S. B. Gathergood.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The Battalion remained in its shallow trenches until
the 18th May under less favourable conditions of weather
than previously, and the exposure caused a large number
of casualties through sickness, including Lieuts. Rivers,
Smith and Cooke, and 2/Lieut. Gathergood, who were
evacuated to hospital.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 18th May the Ferozepore Brigade
took over the front line from the Jullundur Brigade, the
1/4th Londons relieving the 4th Suffolks on the right,
between the La Bassée Road and Oxford Road, the
subsection including Port Arthur Keep where Battalion
Headquarters were established. This tour of duty was
uneventful and the troops were occupied principally in
repairing the damage done to the entanglements and
defences by the enemy's shell fire during the days of the
battle. A certain amount of shell fire was, however,
experienced causing a few casualties, including Captain
Haine, who was hit on the 22nd. The enemy also paid
a good deal of attention to the back areas and the regimental
transport now established at Rouge Croix was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
heavily shelled on the 25th, and again on the 26th, with
such severity that it was compelled to change position
to Riez Bailleul.</p>

<p>During this period also the issue of gas masks to all
ranks was completed.</p>

<p>On the 30th the Sirhind Brigade, which had been in
divisional reserve during the battle, came forward and
took over the line from the Ferozepore Brigade, the 1/4th
Londons handing over their trenches to the 1st Manchesters
and withdrawing to billets at Riez Bailleul.</p>

<p>After the end of May no further attempt was made on
the Indian Corps front to conduct operations on a large
scale. The difficulties under which the Indian battalions
were labouring in the supply of reinforcements to replace
casualties were extreme. The Indian concentration camp
at Marseilles was continually receiving reinforcements
from India, but of these an increasing proportion was
found to be unfit for despatch to the front, and as the
summer wore on the native regiments of the Corps
gradually ebbed in numbers until amalgamations began
to be effected to maintain units at anything approaching
war strength. In these circumstances offensive operations
against so strongly defended a position as the Aubers
Ridge were out of the question, especially having regard
to the continued shortage in the supply of shells. At
the same time the general situation did not permit of the
Indian Corps being entirely withdrawn from the line for
a prolonged rest and reorganisation. The story of the
next three months is, therefore, one of unceasing hard work
in and out of the line without any of those opportunities
of distinction which are as necessary to the well-being of a
battalion&mdash;and especially a native battalion&mdash;as a regular
supply of rations.</p>

<p>This increasing numerical weakness of the native
battalions threw a greater burden of work and responsibility
on the British units, both Regular and Territorial,
though even they experienced the greatest difficulty in
obtaining the regular supplies from home of that fresh
blood which was so earnestly desired. The 1/4th London
returned from Ypres in May at a strength well under 300<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
all ranks, and at no period during the remainder of its
attachment to the Indian Corps did its strength approach
even 450; in other words, for months on end, in sentry-go,
working and carrying parties, and patrols, every man was
doing two men's work; and this with a very scanty proportion
of rest behind the line. Out of 126 days from
the end of May to the beginning of October the 1/4th
Londons spent 92 days in trenches, and of the remaining
34 in billets not one was spent beyond the reach of the
enemy's guns.</p>

<p>With the exception of one tour of duty in the Min
House Farm sector the 1/4th Londons spent this summer
on the right of the La Bassée Road either in the trenches
in front of the Rue du Bois, which included the well-remembered
positions of the Orchard Redoubt and
Crescent Trench, or in reserve, usually in Lansdowne Post,
a large redoubt on Forrester's Lane. The summer months
saw very great improvements in the Rue du Bois trenches.
The isolated listening posts, like grouse-butts, which had
formed the advanced positions in March were now joined
into a continuous line of breastwork, connected with the
Rue du Bois by numerous communication trenches.
Shelters for the trench garrisons were also constructed,
but these gave protection against nothing more serious
than rain&mdash;and not always that. In this waterlogged
area the sinking of a deep dugout was an impossibility,
and the shelters were in consequence mere "rabbit-hutches"
built into the breastwork and covered with
corrugated iron and a few sandbags, which imbued the
occupants with an entirely unjustified sense of security.
At the same time the wire entanglements in No Man's
Land were constantly extended and strengthened. With
all these defences steadily growing, the duties of the
Battalion on working parties, both when occupying the
line and when in reserve billets, were onerous and unceasing.
Patrolling work by night was vigorously prosecuted
as being practically the only available means of
fostering the growth of the "offensive spirit." Trench
routine in 1915 was marked by a feature which in subsequent
years almost entirely vanished&mdash;the constant em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>ployment
of rifle fire. At this period the infantryman
had not succumbed to the insensate craze for bombs
which later ruined his powers as a rifleman; and every
night, in one part of the trenches or another, saw something
in the nature of an organised shoot by the infantry,
bursts of rapid fire being directed on the enemy's parapet.
These practices were of great value, not only in keeping
the men skilful with their rifles, but also in maintaining
their moral superiority over the enemy which might
otherwise have become seriously impaired through their
knowledge of the inequality of our strength in artillery.</p>

<p>The enemy's activity during this summer was for the
most part confined to artillery fire which at times attained
serious proportions and inflicted severe loss; indeed
throughout the period under review the toll of casualties
was steady and continuous.</p>

<p>Out of the trenches the 1/4th Londons withdrew to
reserve billets either at Pont du Hem, L'Epinette, or La
Fosse, and while in reserve were invariably called upon
for working parties in the forward area, so that the opportunities
available for training and repairing the damage
inevitably caused to parade discipline by long-continued
trench life were almost entirely wanting. At this period,
moreover, "back-of-the-line" organisation had not
reached the high pitch attained in later years. Baths
were an infrequent luxury, concert parties&mdash;of an organised
type&mdash;unheard of, recreational training still without its
proper recognition. Such infrequent rests as were granted
to the troops were thus of comparatively small recuperative
value.</p>

<p>But in spite of these numerous difficulties the Battalion
was steadily increasing its military efficiency and its
morale throughout the summer was high.</p>

</div>

<p>One of the most unpleasant tours of duty was at Min
House Farm, already alluded to, a sector on the left of
Neuve Chapelle, facing Mauquissart, which the Battalion
took over for a week in July as a temporary measure
during a readjustment of Brigade boundaries. The
breastworks here were especially weak and very much
overlooked from the Aubers Ridge. Wire was embryonic
and communication trenches poor. Moreover, the area
appeared to be the subject of particular hatred on the
part of the Bosche, who shelled it frequently and heavily.
Min House (or Moated Grange) Farm, where Headquarters
were established, was perched on the crest of a little knoll
which afforded the Headquarters staff a good view over
the sector, but, probably for this very reason, the Hun
objected to it. In fact before the tour of duty came to
an end the farm was totally destroyed by shell fire and
Battalion Headquarters had been forced to make a hasty
exit to Ebenezer Farm, which, being outside the sector
and unprovided with signal communications, was not
ideal for the purpose of a Headquarters.</p>

<p>An extraordinary incident occurred during the last
week of June, which seems worth recording. One night
a patrol of the 129th Baluchis left the British lines to
investigate the condition of the enemy's wire. On its
return one man, Ayub Khan, was missing and all endeavours
to recover his body were fruitless. The following
evening Ayub turned up again, and being taken before
his company commander related how he had entered the
German trenches and passed himself off as a deserter. As
is well known the Germans were always anxious to secure
the defection of the native troops, and Ayub Khan's
arrival was therefore hailed with enthusiasm. He was
taken to the rear and examined carefully. Having kept
his eyes open and seen all he could, Ayub Khan persuaded
the Germans to let him return to our trenches in order
to bring more of his friends over. In a weak moment
the Germans agreed to let him go; but instead of greeting
Ayub and his party of fellow-deserters, they were faced
a few days later with a notice board which was displayed
on our parapet commenting on the incident in suitable
terms. Not being a humourist, the Hun lost his temper,
and it is at this point in the story that the 1/4th Londons
become concerned. The luckless notice board was displayed
on Crescent Trench then occupied by D Company.
At 8.30 a.m. on the 27th June the enemy opened on the
board with 5.9 howitzers, and almost the first shell hit
Capt. Cart de Lafontaine's Headquarters, causing him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
a severe attack of shell-shock and killing his subaltern
2/Lieut. F. F. Hunt. All the morning the "hate" was
continued with great loss to D Company, and by midday
the Crescent Trench was practically obliterated. Company
Sergt.-Major Risley showed great coolness in controlling
his men and withdrawing them as far as was practicable
out of the zone of fire, and set an excellent example of
steadiness under a most trying ordeal. He was subsequently
awarded the D.C.M.</p>

<p>On the 16th June Major L. T. Burnett, who had been
in temporary command of the 1/4th Londons since the
26th April, was promoted Lieut.-Colonel and appointed
to command, Major G. H. M. Vine assuming the duties
of second in command.</p>

<p>At the beginning of September, however, the Battalion
was exceedingly unfortunate in losing Major Vine, who
was sent to hospital with eye trouble, and Lieut.-Col.
Burnett being on leave at the time the command of the
Battalion was assumed until his return by Lieut.-Col.
Murray of the 89th Punjabis.</p>

<p>Early in August Capt. and Adjt. G. B. Scott also said
farewell to the Battalion on taking up an extra-regimental
employment, and the Adjutancy was given to Capt.
W. G. Clark, D.S.O., and subsequently to Capt. E. Giles.</p>

<p>The following officers joined during August and
September:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Lieuts. R. V. Gery, D. J. Leonard, C. Gaskin.</p>

<p>2/Lieuts. S. E. Lyons, H. B. A. Balls, H. Jones, C. C. Spurr, A. G.
Sharp, R. Johnstone, W. J. Boutall, F. C. Fanhangel, S. E. H.
Walmisley, A. S. Ford, G. L. Goodes and H. J. M. Williams.</p></div>

<p>In N.C.O.'s and men the Battalion was less fortunate,
and up to the end of September 3 N.C.O.'s and 14 men,
all veterans of Neuve Chapelle or Ypres, were the only
reinforcements from home.</p>

<p>The casualties in officers for the same period were:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>2/Lieut. F. F. Hunt, killed.</p>

<p>Capt. H. P. L. Cart de Lafontaine, wounded (shell-shock).</p>

<p>Capts. H. W. Weathersbee and H. M. Lorden, and 2/Lieut.
A. G. Sharp, to hospital.</p></div>

<p>Arrangements had now been completed for the launching
of an offensive on the high ground south of La Bassée<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Canal in the direction of Loos and Hulluch. The opening
day of the offensive had been fixed for the 25th September,
and as the Indian Corps was not concerned with the main
action it will be needless for us here to review the course
of events south of the Canal.</p>

<p>North of the Canal, however, a subsidiary operation
of some magnitude had been organised with the strategic
object of increasing the pressure on the German defences
north of La Bassée to such an extent that he would be
compelled under the strain of our main offensive in the
south to relinquish the La Bassée line altogether and
retire to the east of the Aubers Ridge.</p>

<p>To this end an ambitious programme had been drawn
up for the Indian Corps which temporarily included the
newly arrived 19th Division. The preliminary attack
was to be made by the Meerut Division under cover of a
smoke and gas attack to the north of Neuve Chapelle,
with the object of establishing a new line in the first
instance along the road from the Ducks Bill to Mauquissart.
The experience of previous actions having clearly shown
that initial success had frequently been converted into
subsequent failure by a delay in following up the first
advance, it was arranged that the Jullundur and Ferozepore
Brigades and the 19th Division should be prepared immediately
to exploit whatever success should be gained
by the Meerut Division by pushing forward at once to the
line Moulin d'Eau&mdash;La Tourelle&mdash;east edge of Bois du
Biez, while the Sirhind Brigade "leap-frogged" through
them to Lorgies. It was hoped that considerable moral
effect might be obtained by the use of poison gas against
the Germans, and to magnify this as much as possible
arrangements were made for the building up of smoke
screens, one by the Meerut Division to cover the left
flank of its attack and one by the Jullundur Brigade on
the right of the attack; for the projection of a heavy
smoke cloud by the Ferozepore Brigade on the Rue du Bois
and by the 19th Division (holding the extreme Southern
Section, south of the Boar's Head salient); and for an
attempt simultaneously to set fire to the Bois du Biez
by means of incendiary bombs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>Systematic wire cutting on either side of the La Bassée
Road was begun on the 21st September, and a feint
attack was conducted by the Ferozepore Brigade late
in the afternoon of the 22nd in conjunction with the
divisional artillery. This feint attack took the form of
a heavy bombardment of the enemy's front line by
all available guns, starting at about 5 p.m. After five
minutes the guns lifted on to the enemy's support line
and the infantry in the line (Connaughts and 57th Rifles)
by means of rifle fire, lifting dummies on to the parapet
and flashing their bayonets, endeavoured to produce an
impression among the Germans that an attack was
imminent. In the midst of the confusion caused to the
Germans by this demonstration our artillery once more
shortened its range, firing shrapnel on the enemy's front
line. It was believed that this feint attack had the
desired effect: the fire of our guns was certainly accurate
and well distributed, and elicited but little reply from the
enemy. The hostile machine-gun fire, moreover, betrayed
some perturbation inasmuch as it was extremely erratic,
the bullets passing high over the Rue du Bois and doing
no damage. The 1/4th Londons were at this period in
Lansdowne Post.</p>

<p>On the 23rd the weather changed, and the favourable
dry season which had given such promise of success for
our schemes gave way to heavy rains. The wind, too,
veered round to the south-east so that it blew towards
our lines instead of towards the enemy's. This was
particularly disastrous as it would nullify the effect of
the smoke screens and render the use of gas impossible.
It was determined, however, to do all possible to carry
the offensive through to success, and the Lahore Division
was ordered to be completely ready to move forward by
6 a.m. on the 25th September.</p>

<p>Once more, however, the attempt to advance on this
front was foiled. Possibly the feint attack on the 22nd
had been somewhat too theatrical to impress the enemy
and had merely indicated our intentions to him. Certain
it was, however, that on the 25th he was holding his
trenches in particular strength and there remained stolidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
throughout the day in spite of our smoke screens and
demonstrations, to which he replied with vigorous machine-gun
and shell fire. The attempt of the Meerut Division
to push forward proved abortive, and the Lahore Division
was unable to get forward, there being not the least sign
of weakening on the enemy's front opposite to them.
There is no doubt that this failure was in part at least
due to the treachery of the elements. The smoke screen
was utterly ineffective; gas could not be used at all.</p>

<p>The 26th saw the general situation unchanged and
the enemy still sitting in his front line and showing not
the least disposition to leave it.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 26th the 1/4th Londons relieved
the 57th Rifles in a line of reserve posts on the Rue du
Bois in the vicinity of Chocolat Menier Corner (Dog,
Cat, Pall Mall and "Z" Orchard Posts).</p>

<p>The weather had now definitely broken and heavy
rains fell, reducing the trenches to veritable seas of mud.
The Battalion continued to occupy the Keeps until the
evening of the 30th, the duty having passed quietly with
the exception of a small amount of enemy shell fire; but
a large proportion of the shells being "blind" no casualties
were caused. On relief on the 30th the 1/4th Londons
once more withdrew to Lansdowne Post. On the 2nd
October the Ferozepore Brigade was relieved by the
19th Division and moved out to billets in the La Gorgue-Riez
Bailleul area. Here it remained resting and training
for a week, throughout which the weather remained vile
in the extreme.</p>

<p>On the 11th October the Ferozepore Brigade once
more took over the Neuve Chapelle sector from the
Jullundur, the 1/4th Londons occupying the right subsector
with a detachment of the 89th Punjabis<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in Hills
Redoubt and Battalion Headquarters in Sandbag Alley.
On the left of the 1/4th Londons the Brigade sector was
taken up as far as Château Road by the 57th Rifles while
the Connaughts were on the extreme left as far as Sunken
Road.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The 89th Punjabis reached France in June and replaced the 9th
Bhopals in the Ferozepore Brigade.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>
<p>Two days later the Ferozepore Brigade conducted a
second feint attack in conjunction with other operations
which it is not necessary to detail. On this occasion the
feint was timed to take place shortly after midday, the
morning being occupied by our guns in a systematic wire-cutting
shoot, which was followed by a heavy bombardment
of the enemy trenches during the projection of
the smoke screen. Following the smoke screen, smoke
barrages were formed on the flanks of the feint attack
at 1.45 p.m., and simultaneously with them the infantry
in the line operated with rifle fire and demonstrations
similar to those employed on the former occasion to give
the illusion of a pending attack. The wind again
was unfavourable, this time blowing the smoke along
No Man's Land between the lines instead of over the
enemy's trenches; and owing to the strength of the wind
the smoke screen never became dense enough to conceal
the bomb guns by which it was delivered. During the
whole period of the operation our front and rear lines
were subjected to a heavy fire from the enemy's artillery,
which caused very great damage to our breastworks and
wire, guns as heavy as 8-inch being employed with great
intensity between 12.45 and 1.30 p.m. This bombardment
caused large numbers of casualties in the 1/4th Londons,
it being impossible to clear, even temporarily, the bombarded
trenches owing to the necessity of maintaining
as intensely as possible the bursts of rifle fire in accordance
with the scheme. It is a matter of grave doubt as to
whether these demonstrations were worth the casualties
they cost; and it seems abundantly evident that no
useful purpose can have been served by carrying through
a prearranged scheme essentially dependent on the
weather when the conditions on the appointed day were
unfavourable. Perhaps the best comment on the undertaking
is to be found in the orders for the operation, which
included a warning to the effect that "dummies must not
be raised too high so as to show the sticks, as they were
before"!</p>

<p>After the disturbance caused by this operation the
sector relaxed to a condition of remarkable calmness, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
was maintained during the remainder of the tour of duty.
This came to an end on the night of the 27th October
when the Ferozepore Brigade was relieved for the last
time in France by the Jullundur. The 1/4th Londons
were relieved by the 4th Suffolks and withdrew to billets
on the Merville Road at Estaires, the remainder of the
Brigade concentrating in the same area.</p>

<p>The casualties for the month of October included
Lieuts. C. Gaskin and D. J. Leonard, both wounded, the
latter accidentally. During this rest a reinforcement of
about fifty N.C.O.'s and men joined the Battalion.</p>

<p>Rumour had been active for some time as to the
possible transference of the Indian Corps to another
theatre of operations, and on the 31st notification was
received that the Lahore Division would embark at
Marseilles early in November, but that the Territorial units
would not accompany it. The gradual withdrawal of the
Division from the line had in fact begun, and when the
1/4th Londons returned to the reserve trenches in Loretto
Road on the 4th November it had said good-bye to its
good friends of the Ferozepore Brigade and was temporarily
attached to the Jullundur. The following day its
attachment was transferred to the Sirhind Brigade, the
Jullundur having also made its final withdrawal from
the line.</p>

<p>On the 7th the Battalion relieved the 27th Punjabis
(Sirhind) at Ludhiana Lodge, and provided detachments
to hold Church and Hills Redoubts and Curzon Post,
the front line being held by the 4th King's. The three
Territorial battalions of the Division, the 4th Londons,
4th King's, and 4th Suffolks were all now unattached
and were handed over to XI Corps, who were taking
over the line from the Indians with the Guards and
46th Divisions, and a few days of constant change of
positions ensued during the progress of the relief.</p>

<p>On the 8th the 1/4th Londons withdrew to Loretto
Road. This day the long connection of the Battalion
with the Indian Corps, with which it had passed through
pleasant and rough times alike on terms of the closest
friendship, was finally severed. Lieut.-Col. Burnett,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Capt. W. G. Clark, D.S.O., and a detachment of the
Battalion marched to Croix Barbée to bid good-bye to
the divisional commander, Major-Gen. Keary. In the
course of an address to the detachment the General said
that on the occasion of the departure of the Indian Corps
from France and the consequent severance of the Battalion
from the Division, he wished to express his thanks to the
regiment for the good work they had done. Their loyalty
and devotion to duty had been worthy of all praise, their
bearing in action left nothing to be desired, and their
discipline had been excellent throughout. On conclusion
of this address the General handed Lieut.-Col. Burnett a
written Order of the Day.</p>

<p>On the 10th the Battalion moved forward into Brigade
reserve at Pont Logy, and this day was attached to the
137th Brigade of the 46th Division. The weather was
still exceedingly wet, the trenches full of water, and the
conditions in the line owing to the lack of dugouts were
unusually uncomfortable. On the evening of the 14th
the Battalion finally left the Neuve Chapelle area,
billeting at Croix Barbée for the night and continuing its
journey the following day by motor-bus to Lillers, where
it became attached to the 140th Brigade of the 47th
(London) Division.</p>

<p>This concludes the first phase of the 4th London
Regiment's service in France. The year 1915 all along
the line had been one of equilibrium after the defensive
battles of 1914.</p>

<p>We have said enough of the Battalion's life in the
Indian Corps to indicate that the year 1915 was one of
very hard work and continued strain on all ranks. Out
of 255 days spent in the Lahore Division the Battalion
was actually in trenches for 142 days, in reserve billets
providing working parties for 76 days, and at rest only
for 37 days; and although it was worn out and weak
when it withdrew to Lillers in November it was a
thoroughly seasoned fighting battalion, every officer and
man of which was an experienced soldier.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

THE 1/4TH BATTALION IN THE 47TH DIVISION</h2>


<p>The 47th (London) Division to which the 1/4th Londons
were now attached had just withdrawn for a period of
rest and reorganisation from the trenches around Loos
where they had seen a good deal of heavy fighting in the
battle of the 25th September. The Division had come
out from England in March 1915 and had first been
engaged as the extreme right Division of the British Army
at Festubert in May. Although serious losses had been
suffered in the attacks on Hill 70 in September, the
battalions of the Division had subsequently received
strong reinforcements from home, and the majority of
them were far larger than the 1/4th Londons who, at
the date of attachment to the Division, numbered only
24 officers and 435 other ranks.</p>

<p>The Division, which was under command of Major-Gen.
C. St L. Barter, K.C.B., K.C.V.O., comprised the
following Infantry Brigades:</p>

<p>The Division was attached to the IV Corps (Rawlinson)
of the First Army (Haig).</p>

<p>The first day after arrival at Lillers (16th November
1915) was devoted by the Battalion to cleaning up uniforms
and equipment which had, through the prolonged duty
in waterlogged trenches, become caked with weeks of mud.
The general discipline of the 47th Division and of the
140th Brigade in particular was exceedingly good; and
although the battle discipline of the Lahore Division had
been excellent, and the training and experience which the
1/4th Londons had gained while attached to it of the
highest order, yet it cannot be gainsaid that the parade
discipline among the Indian Brigades had not been given
that amount of attention which the long years of war
showed to be necessary, even in the field, to ensure the
best results in action. We have already indicated that
this weakness in the Indian Brigades arose through their
continual deficiency in numbers and the consequent long
periods of trench duty which had been imposed on them.</p>

<p>The sudden change, therefore, from trench duty to a
period of rest, in which ceremonial mounting of guards and
drill were prominent features, created a totally new environment
for the Battalion which was entirely beneficial.</p>

<p>The whole Battalion, from the Commanding Officer to
the most recently arrived draft, was determined to maintain
the reputation of the Battalion; and by dint of
hard work on and off parade the 4th Londons became
rapidly second to none in the Brigade in all the duties
they were called upon to carry out&mdash;and they were the
more impelled to this effort by the realisation that they
were the senior Battalion of the Brigade, not only in
precedence, but also in point of active service experience.</p>

<p>At Lillers the Brigade spent about a month, passed
for the most part in very cold and wet weather, in a
thorough course of training, in which particular attention
was paid to drill and bombing. At this period the question
of the thorough organisation of bombing&mdash;or as they
were then called "grenadier"&mdash;sections with the proper
quota of bayonet men, throwers and carriers was attracting
a great deal of thought, and the time devoted to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
particular branch of the art of war was subsequently
found, as will be seen later, to have been well spent.</p>

<p>Each Battalion mounted daily a quarter guard and an
inlying piquet of one officer, two sergeants, and thirty
rank and file, and the ceremonial mounting of these duties
was carried cut with all possible pomp on the Grande
Place at Retreat.</p>

<p>In addition to this the peace-time system of "extra
drills" as a minor punishment was re-instituted&mdash;not
perhaps an altogether pleasant recollection for some&mdash;but
in spite of the disadvantages such a system must always
have in the eyes of those for whose particular benefit it
is devised, there can be no question that this tightening
of discipline had in the end a beneficial effect on all ranks,
the extent of which it is impossible to overestimate.</p>

<p>The training period was varied by inter-battalion
sports and football matches in which the 1/4th Londons
achieved some success, beating the 7th Battalion 3-1,
and the 6th Battalion 3-1. On the whole the month
passed smoothly with very little incident worthy of
mention beyond a two-day divisional route march which
took place on the 1st and 2nd December.</p>

<p>On the 6th December the 1/4th Londons suffered
a loss in the death of Sergt. Bench, who had very
efficiently carried out the duties of Transport Sergeant
since the Battalion's arrival in France, his death being
the result of injuries caused by a fall from his horse.</p>

<p>During the training at Lillers a most gallant action was
performed by Lieut. H. Jones. While practising throwing
with live bombs one of the men dropped a bomb with the
fuse burning. At great risk Lieut. Jones picked up the
bomb and threw it out of the trench, where it at once
exploded. His bravery undoubtedly saved several lives.</p>

<p>In January, the Battalion was joined by Lieut. V. C.
Donaldson.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The front of attack in the Battle of Loos had extended
from the La Bassée Canal on the left, where our lines
were faced by the village of Auchy, to the village of Loos
on the extreme right. In this attack the first objective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
was the line of the Lens-Hulluch-La Bassée Road, the
frontage being divided more or less equally by the
Vermelles-Hulluch Road, which ran directly out from our
trenches towards the Germans.</p>

<p>North of this dividing line were three very serious
obstacles, namely, Auchy itself defended by impassable
wire entanglements; a work of large area and enormous
strength known as the Hohenzollern Redoubt; and a
group of Quarries close to the Lens-Hulluch Road.</p>

<p>The 9th and 7th Divisions had met with great initial
success on the 25th September 1915, the former overrunning
the Hohenzollern Redoubt and gaining a position
beyond it on a large slag-heap known as Fosse 8, while
elements of the 7th Division sweeping the enemy's defence
of the Quarries before them had gained the outskirts of
Cité St Elie and Hulluch beyond the Lens-Hulluch Road.
The unfortunate check to the advance of the 2nd Division
at Auchy, however, had exposed the left flank of the
9th Division, who were afterwards ejected from Fosse 8,
while the 7th on their right had been unable to retain their
advanced positions across the main road.</p>

<p>Desperate fighting ensued for the possession of these
strongholds until the conclusion of the battle about
13th October. At that date the Germans retained
possession of the whole of the Quarries and the greater
part of the Hohenzollern Redoubt. Between the two
the British had driven a wedge so that the part of
the Hohenzollern which remained in the enemy's hands
formed an abrupt salient, of which the west face was
formed by a trench irreverently named by the British
"Little Willie," and the south face by its obvious companion
"Big Willie." Connecting the eastern extremity
of Big Willie with the north-west corner of the Quarries
the Germans remained in possession of Potsdam Trench,
while the Quarries themselves formed another but smaller
salient in the enemy's lines, well flanked on the south-east
side by our positions, which caused a second abrupt
turn to the east in the enemy lines.</p>

<p>The whole area between these confused positions was
a vast maze of earthworks, for they were in the midst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
what had, prior to the battle, been a strong German
third system of defence and No Man's Land was
traversed by innumerable short communication trenches
and saps, held by the opposing garrisons by means of
barricades, for the possession of which an unceasing and
murderous struggle with bombs and trench mortars was
still proceeding. In addition to these deadly conflicts a
still more subtle warfare was being waged underground,
where our Tunnelling Companies were fighting a battle
of wits with the Germans by mining and counter-mining,
and the blowing of mines followed by fierce local infantry
fights for possession of the craters thus formed were of
frequent recurrence.</p>

<p>A reference to a large map will render clear the extreme
importance to the enemy of the possession of these two
positions. Situate as they were, one on each of the
two lowest spurs of the Vermelles-Hulluch Ridge, their
capture by the British would have involved a very serious
threat to the German defences on the line Auchy-Haisnes,
and might easily have been a prelude to the outflanking
of La Bassée itself. The enemy was obviously alive to
these possibilities, and the daily intelligence reports gleaned
from our patrols and observers made it abundantly clear
that he was strengthening his trenches and wire, and
was burrowing strenuously in opposition to our mining
operations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This severely contested part of the front was taken
over by the 47th Division from the 9th between the 13th
and the 15th December, C Section opposite the Quarries
and D Section opposite the Hohenzollern Redoubt being
occupied by the 141st and 142nd Brigades, the 140th
Brigade remaining in reserve.</p>

<p>For some time after the return to the line the 1/4th
Londons did not enter the trenches as a battalion, but
on account of its small numbers was retained in reserve,
where it performed a great deal of heavy labour in working
and carrying parties for the rest of the Brigade.</p>

<p>On the 15th the 1/4th Londons moved from Lillers
at 8.30 a.m., entraining for Nœux-les-Mines, whence it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
marched to billets at Labourse, training being continued
while the Brigade remained in reserve.</p>

<p>This move was followed by a further approach to the
line which took place on the 19th December, when the
140th Brigade relieved the 141st in C 1 and C 2 Sections,
opposite the Quarries, the 6th and 15th Battalions occupying
the front trenches with the 7th Battalion in support
at Le Philosophe and the 4th and 8th Battalions in Brigade
reserve at Noyelles-les-Vermelles.</p>

<p>Here the 1/4th Londons' duties in carrying and trench
working parties in the forward areas were severe as the
reserve billets were some three miles from the front
line trenches.</p>

<p>The most active part of the Brigade's new front was
C 2, the subsection now garrisoned by the 15th Londons,
where on the left of the Quarries the continuous struggle
already referred to in sapping, bombing and mining was
proceeding with particular violence. The centre of this
fighting was a work held by the British, known as the
Hairpin, and two saps, Essex Trench and Shipka Pass,
which pushed forward from the Hairpin towards the
German lines. Essex Trench in particular was the scene
of much hard fighting, for the Germans were in occupation
of the further end of it and were separated from
our garrison by a double barricade. This trench and
Shipka Pass were coveted by the Germans, as it was
through them that they hoped to obtain a lodgment in
the Hairpin, the possession of which would secure the
right flank of their salient at the Quarries and render
their precarious tenure of that feature much more secure.
With this object they had on the night of the 17th launched
a determined bombing attack along Essex Trench and
Shipka Pass, the enemy bombers being well supported
by trench mortar and rifle grenade fire. Our garrisons,
however, were ready, and none of the enemy reached our
barricades, and their attack was finally dispersed by
our artillery.</p>

<p>This attempt was renewed in the early hours of the
20th, when so vigorous an attack was delivered that the
15th London bombers in Essex Trench were forced back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
from their barricade for some 20 yards, and were unable
for the moment to organise a counter-attack as the
Germans had constructed "arrow head" trenches flanking
his sap, so that he was able to bring fire to bear on our
garrison from three points simultaneously.</p>

<p>After a personal reconnaissance the Brigadier decided
on making the same evening a bid for the recovery of the
lost trench. The 15th London bombers having already
suffered considerable loss, they were reinforced during
the day by the Battalion bombers of the 1/4th Londons,
who moved up to the Hairpin. The day passed quietly
but for some accurate shelling of our positions to the
right of the Quarries, which was stopped by our heavy
guns. At 9.45 p.m. our attack was delivered by three
parties of bombers simultaneously&mdash;one in Essex Trench,
one in a neighbouring sap, and one moving over the open,
flanking support being given by machine-guns posted in
Shipka Pass and west of the Quarries.</p>

<p>The first attack failed, the Essex Trench party on
reaching our old barricade coming once more under a
shower of bombs from three directions, while the sap
party found progress impossible owing to the waterlogged
condition of the sap, and the party in the open were
brought to a standstill by machine-gun fire. Second
and third attempts proved equally unsuccessful, and
after the 23rd December attacks were discontinued
though the enemy portion of Essex Trench was kept
under constant trench mortar fire.</p>

<p>Through all these days the 1/4th London bombers
remained in line, taking an active part in the unceasing
battle of bombs which was pursued between the barricades,
practically without intermission, and unhappily a large
number of casualties was caused.</p>

<p>On the 22nd December a special Order of the Day
was received in which Sir John French said farewell to
the troops on the occasion of his relinquishment of the
Commander-in-Chief; and on the same day Sir Henry
Rawlinson handed over command of the IV Corps to
General Wilson.</p>

<p>Orders were received on the 23rd that in consequence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
certain signs of activity on the enemy's part, the line would
be held in greater strength for the ensuing forty-eight
hours, and in accordance with the prearranged defence
scheme the 1/4th Londons occupied the old British front
line in front of Vermelles early on the morning of the
24th. At 8 a.m. a mine near the Hohenzollern Redoubt was
blown by the British, the crater being successfully occupied
by troops of the 141st Brigade. The Artillery activity
caused by this operation dying down shortly afterwards,
the 1/4th Londons and other units in reserve returned
to their billets later in the day.</p>

<p>During this tour of duty the Brigade Light Trench
Mortar Battery, which was in line in the Hairpin sector,
was joined by 2/Lieut. Goodes. The Battery did exceedingly
good work during the fighting in the Hairpin.
When the 1/4th Londons left the 47th Division Goodes
remained with 47/1 L.T.M. Battery, and was killed at
High Wood in September 1916, having been decorated,
for his consistently gallant service, with the Military
Cross and Bar.</p>

<p>Christmas Day passed in the line without particular
incident beyond the daily "hates" of shells and bombs,
and this year, in consequence of special orders, no attempt
was permitted to indulge in the remarkable fraternisation
with the enemy which had occurred during the first
Christmas of the war.</p>

<p>On the 26th the relief of the 140th Brigade by the
142nd in C Section commenced, and the following day
the 1/4th Londons withdrew to new billets at Sailly
Labourse.</p>

<p>In Divisional reserve the Brigade devoted a few
days to the usual routine of baths, cleaning, refitting and
training, and on the last day of the year once more entered
the trenches, but on this occasion in D Section, the left
sector of the Divisional front, which it took over from
the 141st Brigade, the 6th and 15th Battalions once more
occupying the front system, the 8th Battalion in support
to them, while the 7th who joined the 4th at Sailly
Labourse were with the 4th in Brigade reserve. The new
sector included the trenches opposed to the Hohenzollern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Redoubt, and extended to the left to the vicinity of the
Vermelles-Auchy railway. During the Brigade's short
tenure of the sector the usual shelling and trench
mortar activity continued but without incident of any
particular interest. The 1/4th Londons continued in the
wearisome and unpicturesque task of supplying working
parties.</p>

<p>During the 2nd, 3rd and 4th of January 1916, the
relief of the 47th Division by the Dismounted Division
took place, the 140th being relieved on the morning of
the 3rd by the 1st Dismounted Brigade, withdrawing on
relief to a group of villages some seven miles behind the
line in the Béthune area, the 1/4th Londons billeting at
Drouvin, and the remainder of the Brigade being distributed
between Verquin and Mouchin.</p>

<p>This relief was merely the first stage of a "side-step"
which the Division was making towards the south, and
on the following day the Brigade moved <em>via</em> Nœux-les-Mines
to Les Brebis and made arrangements for the
taking over of a sector of the line south of Loos from
the French.</p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons' service in the Hulluch area had
been arduous owing to the long marches imposed on the
working parties in addition to their tasks, but it had
fortunately, except among the bombers, not been a costly
one, and its strength had not very much decreased since
the date of its joining the Division.</p>

<p>During December a few officer reinforcements were
received as follows: 2/Lieuts. H. G. Beal, C. W. Cragg,
J. Elliott and E. W. Monk, and during January the
Battalion was joined by 2/Lieut. C. F. P. de Pury (to
D Company).</p>

<p>During December also the Quartermaster (Lieut.
E. S. Tomsett) went on leave during which he fell sick,
not returning to the Battalion until the 15th March
1916. In his absence his duties were carried out by
2/Lieut. S. E. H. Walmisley.</p>

<p>In the New Year's Honours List the names of Lieut.-Col.
L. T. Burnett, Capt. W. G. Clark, D.S.O., and Capt.
J. R. Pyper were mentioned in despatches and a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
weeks later the award of the Military Cross to Captain
Pyper was announced.</p>

<p>The new sector taken over by the 47th Division involved
relief of the 18th French Division, and a consequent
extension southwards of the British lines. This sector
roughly comprised the lines in front of the villages of
Maroc and Loos, and had first been taken over from the
French in June 1915. The 47th Division had fought in
this part of the line in the battle of Loos, and carried the
British positions forward through Loos village up to the
famous Double Crassier, and on to the lower slopes of
Hill 70. Subsequently the French had once more taken
the position over from them. This sector was divided
into two subsectors known respectively as Maroc and
Loos, the Maroc subsector on the right including some
1000 yards of trench extending from the vicinity of the
Grenay-Lens railway to the extreme southern limit of
the British advance in September 1915 and also about
1700 yards of the new positions then gained; while the
Loos sector comprised entirely new positions gained in
September and extended for some 1700 yards to the left
completely covering Loos village and the well-known
"Tower Bridge."</p>

<p>On the night of the 5/6 January the 140th Brigade
entered the Maroc sector, the 141st occupying the Loos
sector with the 142nd in Divisional reserve. The difficulties
of the relief were somewhat increased owing to
the fact of taking over French troops, and the difference
of language was the inevitable cause of some delay, but
finally, however, matters were successfully adjusted and
the 140th Brigade was left in possession with the 1/4th
Londons occupying the right subsection, on a frontage
of some 800 yards opposite the "Fosse 16 de Lens";
the 7th Londons in the right-centre subsection, the 15th
Londons in the left-centre subsection, which included
the Double Crassier, and the 6th Londons on the left.
The 8th Battalion were in reserve with two companies
in South Maroc, and two in the old British front line
just in rear of the Double Crassier, which was the danger
point of the Brigade sector, not only on account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
observation of our lines which it afforded the enemy but
also because it lay at the apex of an abrupt re-entrant
in the British front line.</p>

<p>In this sector the 1/4th Londons found their own
supports which were billeted in cellars in South Maroc,
a mining village built on the unattractive "square"
plan of American cities, and consisting of innumerable
rows of artisans' dwellings, then unhappily in a state of
complete ruin. The cellars of these dwellings, however,
still afforded sufficient cover for the concentration unobserved
by the Germans of a considerable body of troops,
and the Germans were evidently somewhat disturbed
at the prospect of this for their artillery, both light and
heavy, paid continual attention to the village both day
and night.</p>

<p>This sector having once more come into occupation
by British troops an enormous amount of work was
immediately necessary to complete the front line and
company supplies of small arms ammunition, bombs,
rifle grenades and trench stores of all sorts; and this
support and reserve companies were kept busily engaged
in this work throughout the tour of duty.</p>

<p>In this sector also the steel shrapnel helmet first made
its appearance, so far as the 1/4th Londons were concerned.
It is amusing to look back on the distrust with which its
advent was first regarded by all ranks alike&mdash;although
afterwards, when once its efficiency and protective
qualities had been tested, it was as highly prized as it
had been previously shunned. The first issue was made
at the rate of one helmet per fire bay, the honour of
wearing it falling to the man on sentry duty for the time
being, and most remarkably disinclined the men were
to assume this undesired badge of office.</p>

<p>On the 9th the 140th Brigade was relieved in the line
by the 142nd, moving on the 13th into the Loos sector,
where it took over the trenches of the 141st Brigade.
The 1/4th Londons did not take part in this relief but
remained in the right subsection, temporarily under the
orders of the 142nd Brigade, with the 22nd Londons on
their left. Here the Battalion remained until the 16th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
when it was relieved by the 17th Battalion, rejoining the
140th Brigade in rest billets at Haillicourt.</p>

<p>On the 19th January Lieut.-Col. L. T. Burnett left
the Battalion on short leave, and as it unfortunately
proved, permanently, for he fell seriously ill while on
leave and was unable to return to duty for nearly a year.
The command was assumed during his absence by Major
W. G. Clark, D.S.O., while Major S. Elliott became temporarily
second in command. The loss of Lieut.-Col. Burnett
was keenly felt. His nine months' command had been
marked by a striking advance in the Battalion's efficiency
and by the unswerving loyalty of all ranks under his
command. Later he joined the Reserve Battalion in
England, being subsequently transferred to employment
in the War Office.</p>

<p>At Haillicourt the Battalion spent a few days in rest
and training and returned to the trenches on the 24th
January, occupying the same subsector as on the
previous occasion with the 7th Londons once more on
its left.</p>

<p>This tour of duty was marked by particularly heavy
artillery activity on both sides, the Germans shelling our
trenches and Maroc daily with great accuracy and using
a good deal of gas shell. A certain number of casualties
inevitably occurred, but, having regard to the continued
intensity of the bombardment, the number was remarkably
small.</p>

<p>On the 27th January the Kaiser's birthday was celebrated,
and it was somewhat confidently anticipated that,
as in 1915, the Germans would endeavour to score some
success against the British. It had been known for some
time that enemy mining operations in this area had been
proceeding apace, and it therefore appeared not improbable
that the Germans would endeavour to time the firing
of their mines for the 27th. Preparations to meet this
possibility were made. The Kaiser's birthday did indeed
prove to be a day of considerable activity, and though
the Germans delivered an abortive attack against the
15th Division on the left no infantry movement occurred
opposite the 140th Brigade; and their activity was con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>fined
to shell fire, which assumed serious proportions on
the 27th and again on the 28th. Our artillery, however,
was ready with heavy retaliatory fire and by the evening
of the 30th conditions in the Maroc sector had reverted
to something approaching quietness.</p>

<p>During this period the newly arrived 16th (Irish)
Division of the New Army was attached to the 47th Division
for instruction in trench warfare, the 1/4th Londons taking
over the supervision of the 8th Munsters, among whom
unfortunately several casualties were caused by hostile shell
fire on the 30th. The 31st January was marked principally
by heavy British artillery fire, which elicited but little
response from the enemy and inflicted considerable damage
on his wire and defences generally.</p>

<p>The following day the 140th Brigade handed over its
trenches to the 142nd, the 1/4th Londons being relieved
by the 21st Londons and proceeding to rest billets in
Haillicourt.</p>

<p>This tour of duty really brought to a conclusion the
Battalion's service with the 47th Division, for though it
did not part from the Brigade until the 9th February, the
intervening days were spent in training, route-marching
and cleaning.</p>

<p>On the 8th Brig.-Gen. Cuthbert&mdash;then in temporary
command of the Division&mdash;inspected the 1/4th Londons
prior to their departure, and addressed the troops;
and the following day the Battalion marched to Béthune,
entraining for Pont Remy (near Abbeville), and marched
via Hallencourt to Citerne, where it went into billets
attached to the 168th Brigade of the newly formed
56th (London) Division, an attachment which remained
unbroken to the end of the War.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

THE 2/4TH BATTALION IN MALTA, GALLIPOLI PENINSULA
AND SOUTHERN EGYPT</h2>


<p>On the departure from Malta of the 1st London Infantry
Brigade on the 2nd January 1915, the 2/1st Brigade
became responsible in its place for the defence of the
Fortress.</p>

<p>The 2/4th Londons settled down at St George's
Barracks to a vigorous course of training. A musketry
course under Fortress arrangements was begun and also
special classes for the Machine-Gun and Transport sections,
those for the latter being conducted by the A.S.C. at
Musta Fort. The Battalion also provided a detached
company to continue the duties of prisoner of war guard
at Verdala Barracks, which had formerly been carried out
by a company of the 1/4th Battalion.</p>

<p>Shortly after the relief of the garrison, Major J. F. F.
Parr, R.A.M.C.T., who had been medical officer of the
1/4th Londons, was appointed to be M.O. in charge of
Imtarfa Hospital.</p>

<p>During the 2/4th Londons' duty in Malta they were
frequently called on to find the "public duties" consisting
of an officer's guard at the Governor's Palace in Valetta,
and guards over various government depôts, the first
Palace Guard being found on the 9th February.</p>

<p>The 10th February was celebrated as a festival on the
island, being the anniversary of St Paul's shipwreck, and
the usual religious procession took place.</p>

<p>On the 11th February the Battalion moved from
St George's Barracks to Floriana Barracks, Valetta.</p>

<p>The following day H.E. the Governor-General, General
Sir Leslie Rundle, G.C.B., G.C.V.O., K.C.M.G., D.S.O.,
and staff left Malta for England, and on the 12th the new
Governor-General (Field-Marshal Lord Methuen, G.C.B.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
G.C.V.O., C.M.G.) arrived and took up his residence at
the Palace.</p>

<p>At this period occurred two events of paramount
importance which materially affected the part which the
Malta Station was destined to play in the War. The first
of these was the opening on the 25th April 1915 of combined
military and naval operations against the Gallipoli
Peninsula; the second being the decision to throw in
her lot with the Allies of Italy, who declared war on
Austria on the 22nd May 1915.</p>

<p>The effect of the former of these events was to render
British naval supremacy in the Mediterranean, and consequently
the security of the Mediterranean Fleet Headquarters
at Malta, of vital importance; and of the second
to ensure both desiderata not only by the relief from the
menace of a potential enemy at no great distance from
the island, but also by the accession to the Allied strength
of the powerful Italian Navy, which formed an additional
protection to Malta against the possibility of a surprise
raid by Austria.</p>

<p>From this date onwards, therefore, the function of Malta
became one not so much of a fortress as of a base of operations,
and a highly useful evacuating station for the casualties
from Gallipoli who now began to be drafted to the island
in great numbers. The accommodation on the island for
hospitals being limited to the normal service requirements
of peace time, the congestion rapidly became serious, and
the troops of the garrison vacated their barracks, going
under canvas in the barrack squares in order to provide accommodation
for the sick and wounded; the 2/4th Londons
moving to the parade ground at Ghain Tuffieha Camp.</p>

<p>On the 26th July a warning order was issued to the
Battalion, which was still regarded as a draft-finding unit
to the 1/4th Battalion, to prepare a draft of 400 other
ranks to reinforce the 1/4th Battalion in France. The
resulting deficiency in the 2/4th Battalion was to have
been made up by a draft of equal size from the newly
formed 4/4th Battalion in England, and although this
latter draft actually embarked at Southampton, the order
was cancelled; and it appears that the decision was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
made at this time, doubtless owing to the wastage of
personnel at Gallipoli, to treat the 2/4th Londons as a
service battalion and to leave the duty of provision of
drafts for both the 1/4th and 2/4th Battalions to the
3/4th and 4/4th Battalions at home.</p>

<p>The following officers were invalided home from
Malta: Major J. F. F. Parr, R.A.M.C.T., Capt. W. G.
Hayward, 2/Lieuts. L. R. Chapman and N. L. Thomas.
The Battalion was joined on the 13th August by:
2/Lieuts. B. F. L. Yeoman, H. G. Hicklenton, C. P.
Darrington and N. W. Williams. Capt. Hayward's duties
as Adjutant were taken over by Capt. L. C. Coates.</p>

<p>On the 12th July Lieut. Simpson was ordered to
join the 2nd Royal Fusiliers, then attached to the 29th
Division at the Dardanelles, and was posted to the
Machine-Gun Section of that Battalion.</p>

<p>During this period training was proceeding to such
extent as was possible in view of the congested state of
the island, and detachments were supplied for fatigue
duties at St Andrew's and St Patrick's Camps, Imtarfa
Hospital, and for coast defence at 9th Mile Stone (between
St Paul's and Salina Bays).</p>

<p>On the 12th August three signallers of the Battalion,
the first other ranks to proceed on active service, left
for the Dardanelles attached for duty to H.M.S. <em>Euryalus</em>.
Two days later a warning order was issued for the Battalion
to prepare for embarkation to Egypt.</p>

<p>Before departure from Malta the 2/4th Londons were
inspected on the 14th August by H.E. the Governor, who
subsequently issued a Fortress Order to the following
effect:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is a pleasure to His Excellency to say with truth
that it has been a source of satisfaction to him to have
had the four Territorial battalions of the City of London
Regiment under his command. Their conduct has been
excellent under trying conditions lately on account of the
heavy and unceasing fatigue work they have had to
perform. Their appearance in Valetta, the smart way in
which the men salute, the alacrity of the Main Guards in
turning out, all show the efficiency of the Battalions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
His Excellency wishes Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers
and men "God Speed," and if from Egypt they go to the
Front he looks to them with confidence to uphold the
high reputation of the City of London Regiment.</p></div>

<p>On August 19th camp at Ghain Tuffieha was struck
and the Battalion marched to Valetta, embarking next
day on H.T. <em>Southlands</em>&mdash;which sailed for Egypt on
the 21st, arriving at Alexandria on the 25th. The
Battalion disembarked and marched to quarters under
canvas at Sporting Club Camp on the seashore, where it
remained until October 6th.</p>

<p>The strength on proceeding to Egypt was 30 officers
and 765 other ranks, the officers, N.C.O.'s and men who
were not passed fit for active service remaining under
Lieut. V. W. Edwards in Malta for garrison duty, until
September 1916, when they returned to the Reserve
Battalion in England.</p>

<p>At Alexandria the Battalion provided duties, including
the Main and Ras-el-tin Guards and town pickets; and
also a detachment of 3 officers and 100 other ranks at
Keb-el-Dick Fort, from which further guards were supplied
for Chatty Cable Station, Supply Stores and other points
of importance.</p>

<p>The Battalion was inspected by the Brigadier, the
Earl of Lucan, on the 6th October, who in an address to
the troops said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have come here to-day to do something which is
quite sad for me, and that is to say good-bye to you. I
wish you all every success, good luck, and a safe return
to England. I trust we shall all meet again.</p>

<p>I am proud that I have been in command of the 1st
London Infantry Brigade and am exceedingly sorry that
I am not coming with you. I had hoped that the four
battalions of the London Regiment would have gone to
the Front as a Brigade.</p>

<p>I much appreciate the hard work you all did at Malta
and I send you from here with every confidence that you
will acquit yourselves in the future as I know you have
done in the past, and you will uphold the great reputation
you have gained. I feel sure you will do great credit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
yourselves and to the City of London Regiment wherever
you go.</p></div>

<p>The commanding officer also received a letter from
Major-Gen. Sir A. Wallace, C.B., commanding the
troops at Alexandria, expressing his appreciation of the
discipline and bearing of the Regiment and affirming his
conviction of the exemplary manner in which it would
carry out its duties on active service.</p>

<p>The same day embarkation commenced on to H.T.
<em>Karroo</em> at Alexandria, and on the 9th, under escort of
two destroyers, the <em>Karroo</em> sailed for Mudros, arriving on
the evening of 12th October. The following officers did
not accompany the Battalion to Mudros:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Capts. G. H. Moore and H. Parkhouse (seconded for duty, in the
Censor's Office, Cairo).</p>

<p>Lieut. H. W. Dennis (granted leave to England) and 2/Lieut.
F. R. C. Bradford (in hospital).</p></div>

<p>For two days the Battalion remained on board in
Mudros Harbour, but on the 15th was transhipped to
H.T. <em>Sarnia</em>, which put to sea about 3 p.m. At midnight
the transport anchored off Cape Helles and the
Battalion disembarked on to the Gallipoli Peninsula at
W. Beach and bivouacked in dugouts in the early hours
of the 16th October 1916.</p>

<p>The Battalion was now attached to the Royal Naval
Division, the infantry of which consisted of the following
units:</p>

<p>The Division was attached with the 42nd (South
Lancashire) and 52nd (Lowland) Territorial Divisions to
the VIII Corps (Lieut.-Gen. Sir Francis Davies, K.C.B.).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The 2/4th Londons landed on the Peninsula at a
critical period in the fortunes of the expedition, and in
order to render clear the position of affairs in the middle
of October, some reference is necessary to the course which
events had taken since the inception of the campaign.</p>

<p>After witnessing the "amphibious battle" between
British battleships and the land forts of the Dardanelles,
which took place on the 18th March 1915, General Sir
Ian Hamilton had formed the conclusion that the Navy
would be unable to open the way to Constantinople
without the fullest co-operation of all the military forces
at his disposal.</p>

<p>The Gallipoli Peninsula runs in a south-westerly
direction from its isthmus at Bulair, where it is spanned
by fortified lines, for some fifty-two miles to its extreme
point, Cape Helles, attaining in its centre a breadth of
nearly twelve miles.</p>

<p>The northern coast of the northern portion slopes
abruptly towards the Gulf of Zeros in a chain of hills
extending as far as Cape Suvla, the declivitous nature
of the coastline precluding serious military landings. In
the southern half, which is more accessible from the sea,
the main features consist of Achi Baba, dominating the
extreme end of the Peninsula; Sari Bair Mountain, a
succession of almost perpendicular escarpments overlooking
Suvla Bay; and the Kilid Bahr plateau protecting
the forts of the Narrows against attacks from the
north coast.</p>

<p>As a result of a reconnaissance of this unpromising
feature it became abundantly evident to Sir Ian Hamilton
that he could achieve success and overcome the difficulties
caused by the inadequacy of the landing places and the
improvements made by the Turks in their defences since
the 18th March, only by rapidly flinging ashore the
largest possible force at several landing places simultaneously.
The glorious achievement of the landings at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Cape Helles and Anzac on the 25th April are now matters
of history, and lack of space makes it impossible to repeat
the epic here. We can only record the fact that in face
of innumerable difficulties and a murderous fire from the
Turkish lines and forts, landings were in fact effected.
By the end of the month, by dint of furious and practically
continuous fighting, the French and British were definitely
though precariously established on the south-west extremity
of the Peninsula on a line running from sea to
sea about three miles north of Cape Helles.</p>

<p>It was obviously essential to exploit the initial success
as quickly as possible in order to carry the Allied lines
forward before the Turkish reinforcements should arrive,
and in spite of the exhaustion of the troops, fighting of
the most desperate character continued on both the
Helles and the Anzac fronts throughout May. But so
enormously strong were the Turkish entanglements and
trenches, and so well placed their machine-guns, that the
Allied progress was slow and achieved only at appalling
cost.</p>

<p>On the 6th-8th June a last attempt was made on the
Helles front to carry the village of Krithia and the slopes
of Achi Baba, but this attack met with a similar fate to
its predecessors, and the nett result after a severe struggle
was an advance of some 200 yards; the line thus gained
representing the most advanced position ever occupied
on this front.</p>

<p>As a result of strong representations by the Commander-in-Chief,
fresh forces were concentrated by the end of June
consisting of the 10th, 11th and 13th Divisions of the New
Armies, and the 52nd (Lowland), 53rd (Wessex) and 54th
(East Anglian) Territorial Divisions, the two last-named
being represented by infantry only.</p>

<p>The impossibility of attaining further success by
frontal attacks at Helles now being clear, Sir Ian Hamilton
determined to employ his fresh forces in endeavouring to
strangle the Turkish defence by an attack across the
Peninsula from Anzac, in a south-easterly direction
towards Maidos; supported by a fresh landing farther
up the coast at Suvla Bay.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_b_092fp.jpg" width="700" height="276" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><em>V Beach, Cape Helles</em></p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>The new operation was launched on the 6th August.
The main attack from Anzac involved as a preliminary
objective the occupation of the heights of Sari Bair, the
possession of which would enable us to bring rifle fire to
bear on the enemy communications with Helles and,
moreover, bring the Narrows within field-gun range.
So nearly to success did this attack attain that had it
received the support which had been anticipated from
the Suvla Bay landing, with its consequent diversion of
Turkish reserves, there can be little doubt that the advance
would have developed into one of first-rate importance.
New Zealand troops did, in fact, scale the heights of
the main ridge, but in subsequent counter-attacks were
forced to yield to the enemy, and the few hundred yards
of ground which stood between us and decisive victory
were denied to us.</p>

<p>The actual landing at Suvla on the 8th was effected,
as had been hoped, as a complete surprise to the enemy,
and met with little resistance. But the exhaustion of
the troops, caused by a failure in the water supply
arrangements, led to the waste of many valuable hours
of daylight in which no advance was possible and enabled
the enemy to prepare a stubborn resistance to our further
attacks, and the opportunity passed for ever.</p>

<p>During August and September the supply of reinforcements
and munitions for the Dardanelles Army fell off
seriously, and in the middle of October the position had
become stabilised.</p>

<p>The general situation had indeed changed most unfavourably
for our chances of ultimate success. The
wholesale retirement of our Russian Allies during the
summer had released large numbers of enemy reserves
for the Gallipoli theatre, and the recrudescence of enemy
submarine activity in the Ægean Sea increased the difficulties
of supply and transport from the bases at Mudros
and Imbros, so that whereas the Allied forces had indeed
shot their bolt, the enemy's strength was still increasing.</p>

<p>Since the Suvla landing no further active operations
had been attempted, but constant pressure was maintained
on the Turkish lines by our trench garrisons in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
mining and bombing, while our artillery continually
harassed him in his advanced and rearward positions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The 1st Brigade was out of the trenches on the arrival
of the 2/4th Londons and the first few days were therefore
spent by the Battalion in the rest camp at W. Beach
(Cape Helles) in providing working parties and unloading
stores, while the senior officers of the Battalion visited a
sector of the trenches. The fact should not be overlooked
in connection with the 2/4th Battalion's record that
owing to the narrowness of our foothold on the Peninsula
it was impossible to withdraw troops, even when "at
rest," beyond the shelled zone, and the beaches were
constantly under fire of heavy batteries on the Asiatic side.</p>

<p>On the 19th Oct. the Adjutant, Capt. L. C. Coates,
was admitted to hospital suffering from pleurisy and his
duties were taken over by Capt. J. R. Webster.</p>

<p>The Allied lines on the Helles front stretched from
sea to sea in a direction from south-east to north-west
about a thousand yards short of Krithia village. The
trench system was divided into two approximately equal
portions by the Krithia Road, which, connecting Krithia
with the village of Sedd-el-Bahr, near Cape Helles,
traversed a ridge which formed the backbone of this part
of the Peninsula. On the right of the road the lines were
held by the French, their right flank (nearest the Narrows)
being drawn back slightly on the near side of a deep gorge
called Kereves Dere, the waters of which discharged into
the Dardanelles. On the left of the road the lines were
in the occupation of the VIII Corps, and were divided
into three sections, of which at this date the right was
held by the 52nd, the centre by the Royal Naval and the
left, next the Ægean Sea, by the 42nd Division.</p>

<p>The VIII Corps front was intersected by two deep
ravines respectively called Gully Ravine, near the Ægean
coast, and Krithia Nullah on the immediate left of the
Krithia Road, and both of these, originating in the slopes
of Achi Baba, formed deep furrows through the British
lines, running towards the sea in a direction roughly
parallel to the Krithia Road. The high ground between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the ravines formed a plateau covered with scrub and
gorse, and intersected in all directions by water courses
of less importance; the whole area being uncomfortably
exposed to direct observation from the Turkish defences
on Achi Baba. All along this front the British and
Turkish lines were close together&mdash;in some places only
about 30 yards apart&mdash;and a continual and deadly warfare,
in which bombs played a prominent part, was being waged
from sapheads pushed out from the main defensive
positions and held by barricades.</p>

<p>The Royal Naval Division's subsector included several
of such centres of activity, notably at the Northern and
Southern Barricades, on the left, and at Worcester
Barricade, a sap pushed forward from the Rue de Paris,
in the centre.</p>

<p>The exposure of the whole British area to observation
rendered necessary the use of very long communication
trenches, to afford cover to the mule transport whereby
the trench garrisons were supplied with rations and trench
stores. These wide mule tracks, doubled for upward and
downward traffic, were carried forward from the crest
of the plateau above the beaches at Cape Helles to within
a few hundred yards of the front trenches.</p>

<p>On the 20th October the 1st R.N. Brigade relieved
the 2nd Brigade in the centre subsection, the forward
system of trenches being occupied by "Drake," "Nelson,"
"Hood" and "Hawke," the 2/4th Londons relieving the
2/2nd Londons in the Eski line, a reserve line some 1500
yards in rear of the most advanced trenches. The
Battalion occupied this line with two companies each
side of the Eastern Mule Trench. The relief was carried
out without difficulty, but during the move forward from
bivouacs the Battalion incurred its first battle casualties,
Capt. H. Morris and Privates Housden and Maunder
being wounded.</p>

<p>At this time the Turkish Feast of Barram was proceeding,
and when it drew to a close on the evening of the
22nd it was anticipated with some confidence that the
enemy would attempt a demonstration against the Allied
positions. The only activity, however, was on our side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
and our batteries both on land and sea gave the Turks
a particularly hot time during the evening. During this
tour the weather began to break and heavy rains fell,
but apart from the wet condition of the trenches and the
consequent additional work in keeping them in repair
the tour of duty passed without incident of an unusual
nature. On the 22nd half the company officers and non-commissioned
officers were attached for instruction in the
front line to the R.N. Battalions, their places being taken
after forty-eight hours by the other half.</p>

<p>On the 27th the 2nd Brigade returned to the line
relieving the 1st Brigade, which withdrew on relief to the
Rest Camp, the 2/4th Londons handing over their positions
in the Eski line to the 2/2nd Londons.</p>

<p>This day General Sir Ian Hamilton handed over
command-in-chief of the Dardanelles Army to General
Sir C. C. Monro, K.C.B. Sir Charles Monro's duty on
assuming command was in the first instance to report
as to the desirability, on purely military grounds, of
evacuating the Peninsula, and alternatively as to the
force required to bring the campaign to a successful issue.
A reconnaissance of the position led him to the conclusion
that evacuation should be taken in hand, and the adoption
of this course received official approval, with results which
will be recorded in their place.</p>

<p>In the Rest Camp the Battalion spent six days, which
were occupied in work on new winter quarters and dugouts,
and which passed quietly but for heavy shelling
on the 29th October and the 1st November from enemy
batteries on the Asiatic shore; but fortunately no
casualties were suffered.</p>

<p>The month of November was occupied in duty in and
out of the line, tours in the trenches being for seven days,
followed by seven days in the Rest Camp at Cape Helles.
For both the tours in line the 2/4th Londons were in
reserve in the Eski lines though on each occasion companies
were sent in turn to the front trenches for instruction
in trench warfare. For this purpose they were attached
to "Hawke," "Hood" and "Drake" Battalions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>The Turks at this period were comparatively quiet
beyond a certain amount of artillery fire, and for the
companies in the Eski line the time passed by no means
unpleasantly. Engaged in strengthening and improving
the defences during working hours, they were allowed
when off duty to go in small parties down to Gully Beach
on the Ægean coast. These small excursions were the
means of providing a change of diet, for the men seldom
returned without a good haul of fish, caught by a stratagem
in which, so rumour has it, the Mills Bomb figured
prominently.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before the Battalion discovered
that their worst enemy on the Peninsula was the
elements. The summer heat had now broken and the
autumn rains were beginning with all their sub-tropical
violence. The Battalion's first introduction to these
deluges occurred on the 10th November, when, having
just returned from the trenches to the Rest Camp, it was
treated to a violent rainstorm which flooded all the dugouts
and shelters.</p>

<p>A week later when the 2/4th Londons had returned
to the line a thunderstorm burst over the lines and heavy
rain fell for about two hours, flooding many trenches and
rendering them almost untenable. This storm was followed
by several days of rain and high wind which inflicted considerable
hardship on the troops, not only while they were
actually in the trenches but also by reason of the serious
damage caused to the Rest Camp, so that on coming out
of the line when the tour of duty was over the conditions
of discomfort were unabated.</p>

<p>This sort of incident, which recurred during the rainy
season with monotonous frequency, was far more productive
of discomfort and ill effects than it would have
been on the Western front; since owing to the restriction
of space it was impossible to attain on the Peninsula to
anything approaching the degree of "back-of-the-line"
organisation which was reached in France. Wet clothes,
therefore, remained wet until the sun dried them, and
the inevitable result was a constantly high proportion of
sickness, which during the last few months on the Peninsula
accounted for vastly more casualties than the enemy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
weapons. But under the most unpromising circumstances
the British soldier invariably manages to make himself
as comfortable as possible and to undergo severe privations
with a sort of fatalistic and stoical cheerfulness,
which he vainly endeavours to conceal by much "grousing."
And so on the Peninsula, a locality scarcely
associated as a rule with ideas of amusement, a certain
amount of recreation was obtained by football matches,
and by the efforts of the bands of the four London
battalions who played in different battalion areas each
evening when the Brigades were out of the trenches. The
officers also were able to obtain some exercise through
the kindness of the officers of the 2nd Royal Fusiliers
(29th Division) who lent their horses, on which a few
pleasant 'longshore excursions' were made.</p>

<p>The few days out of the trenches were occupied in
supplying working parties for the construction of the
new winter quarters.</p>

<p>On the 20th November the Battalion was issued with
gas masks, and received its first instruction in defensive
measures against gas attacks. It was believed at this
time that steps were being taken by the Turks to employ
poison gas against the Allies, but none was actually used
against the 2/4th Londons.</p>

<p>Hitherto the Battalion had fortunately suffered but
few casualties at the hands of the enemy, the total in
all ranks amounting to 4 killed and 5 wounded. Sickness,
however, now began to take a heavy toll of all units, and
this became especially serious after the 26th November,
on which day a storm of unprecedented violence burst
over the Peninsula, accompanied by torrential rain, which
rapidly filled the trenches and forced the occupants on
both sides on to the parapets, where they crouched unable
to move for fear of falling into the trenches and being
swept away by the torrents which poured down them
and overflowed on to the land adjoining. In the Rest
Camps the dugouts were rapidly flooded out and the
troops spent a night of bitter exposure. In the afternoon
of the following day the wind suddenly shifted to the
north, and a biting frost ensued. The cold was agonising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
and the water froze around the men's feet as they slept
from sheer exhaustion. Greatcoats which had been
drenched by the rains were so stiffened by the frost that
they stood up by themselves. So severe was the cold
that it was only by keeping the men constantly at work
with their shovels that many were kept alive at all. On
the 28th snow began to fall, and the blizzard continued
throughout the day and during the 29th. In the meantime
the sea had become very rough and the temporary
quays and breakwaters suffered great damage, both on
the Peninsula and at Mudros and Imbros, and this added
seriously to the difficulties of the already over-burdened
transport services.</p>

<p>During the first few days of December over 200 deaths
occurred from exposure and over 10,000 sick were evacuated
from the Peninsula; and from the statements of
deserters it is probable that the Turks suffered even more
severely. A famous war correspondent who was at Cape
Helles at the time wrote: "Never probably since
Crimean days have British forces in the field had to endure
such cold as the last days of November brought to our men
at the Dardanelles."</p>

<p>On the 29th 2/Lieut. P. C. Darrington was evacuated
to hospital.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Darrington on recovery transferred to the 5th London Regiment
(L.R.B.) with whom he served till almost the end of the War, being
unhappily killed a few days before the Armistice.</p></div>

<p>On the 1st December the 1st Brigade returned to the
trenches and this time the 2/4th Londons took over a
sector of the front line between "Drake" on the right,
and "Hood" on the left. The sector included a part of
the front line known as Rue de Paris, from Sap B to
Sap N, which was occupied by A and C Companies, while
D Company went into support in Worcester Flats with B
in reserve in Munster Terrace, the machine-guns being
in front line positions. This day the enemy's artillery
was more active than it had been for months, and for three
hours in the afternoon the British lines generally were
subjected to a violent bombardment by field guns and
howitzers; but although an attack was believed to be
imminent no infantry movements developed, and in the
evening the situation became quieter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Although this tour of duty was not unusually active,
there were abundant signs of a considerable accession
of strength behind the Turkish lines, and daily his artillery
became a little more active, a good deal of shelling being
caused by the registering of fresh batteries on our lines.
The Turkish snipers also became particularly annoying,
and their efficiency reflected itself in our casualty list
which, though not large, was somewhat longer than usual.
On the evenings of the 9th and the 11th the Turks employed
a field searchlight from behind Achi Baba, but
the experiment was not repeated and led to no incident
of interest.</p>

<p>Col. Dunfee was granted a month's leave of absence
on urgent private affairs, and left the Peninsula for England
on the 5th, the command of the Battalion devolving upon
Major V. H. Seyd who continued in command, with the
acting rank of Lieut.-Col., until after the final evacuation
of the Peninsula, the duties of second in command being
assumed by Capt. R. N. Arthur.</p>

<p>During this tour a draft of 49 N.C.O.'s and men under
2/Lieuts. J. W. Price and S. Davis joined the 2/4th
Londons from England, and was posted to companies.
2/Lieuts. N. L. Thomas and F. R. C. Bradford rejoined
from hospital.</p>

<p>The following is an extract from Battalion orders for
the 12th December:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Commanding Officer would like to place on record
that whilst with the Grenade Section in the trenches last
week No. 2827 Pte. Hedger threw back a live grenade
which had fallen into the trench, thereby saving his comrades
and himself from injury.</p></div>

<p>On the 9th December a relief was effected, combined
with a readjustment of the boundaries of the Divisional
sector on the arrival of the 29th Division from the Suvla
Bay front; and practically half the centre subsection
from Sap F (half-way along the 2/4th Londons' line) to
the left, occupied by two companies of the 2/4th Londons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
"Hood" and "Hawke," was handed over to the King's
Own Scottish Borderers. On the following morning A, B
and C Companies and Battalion Headquarters withdrew
to the Rest Camp. D Company remained in line attached
to "Drake" until the 11th, when it rejoined the Battalion.</p>

<p>This relief being, as already stated, carried out in the
course of a readjustment of the line, the Brigade spent only
four days out of the trenches, and on the 15th it took
over a fresh sector facing Kereves Dere on the right of
Achi Baba Nullah. Of this new sector about 750 yards
were taken over from the 2nd R.N. Brigade while the
French troops were relieved in about 250 yards of trench
adjoining on the right. The sector was occupied with
"Nelson" on the left, and "Drake" and A and B Companies,
2/4th Londons, on the right. Battalion Headquarters
and C and D Companies occupied the Eski
line in rear of the new sector, in this part called the
Tranchée d'Amade, with one company each side of the
junction with the main communication trench, the Avenue
de Constantinople.</p>

<p>The days following the occupation of this sector were
marked by considerable activity on the part of the
enemy's bombers. The hostile trenches opposite the 2/4th
Londons were on an overage about 70 yards from the
British front line and numerous saps had been pushed
out toward them, from the heads of which the struggle
continued without cessation, the Grenadiers on each side
plying their objectionable trade without abatement.</p>

<p>On the 17th B Company relieved A Company in the
front trenches. Capt. F. C. J. Read this day was
evacuated to hospital, being followed there next day by
Lieut. R. C. Dickins.</p>

<p>On the 20th December the announcement was made
in Corps orders of the successful evacuation of the Suvla
and Anzac positions which had taken place during the
night of the 19th.</p>

<p>The details of the scheme for this evacuation had been
carefully worked out by Sir William Birdwood who had
been appointed to command of the Dardanelles Army
on the formation of the Salonika Army (Sir C. C. Monro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
assuming supreme command of the Mediterranean Forces).
The scheme provided for the completion of this difficult
operation in three stages, the first of which involved the
embarkation of all troops, animals and supplies not
required for a prolonged campaign; this was to be
followed by the evacuation of troops, guns, stores, etc.,
not immediately required for the defence of our positions,
while the third and final stage consisted of the embarkation
of the rearguard troops and the destruction of all
guns, animals and stores which could not be removed.</p>

<p>The actual evacuation had been fixed for as early a
date as possible owing to the improbability of the long
continuance of favourable weather; and at both Suvla
and Anzac the process was completed without a hitch
of any kind, only a small quantity of stores having to
be destroyed, and without any interference on the part
of the enemy.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after this operation a marked
increase in the Turkish activity on the Helles front took
place, probably on account of the release of large numbers
of his batteries in the evacuated sectors.</p>

<p>In announcing the completion of this operation, the
special order of the day affirmed that the Helles position
was not to be abandoned, but that on the contrary the
VIII Corps was entrusted with the task of holding to this
theatre of operations as large as possible a force of Turkish
troops in order to prevent their employment elsewhere.
To this end the battalions holding the line were urged to
maintain their pressure against the enemy at all points
while schemes were evolved for the construction of deep
dugouts, the improvement of reserve lines, and other
works, which would only be necessary in the event of a
long continued occupation of the Peninsula.</p>

<p>Information was even disseminated that large reinforcements
totalling over 1600 all ranks were on the way,
and were expected shortly. But behind all these precautions
against the leakage of information among the
Turks as to our intentions, and under cover of the various
fictions above described, preparations were being pressed
forward for the evacuation of the Helles front also;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
preparations which needed particular care not only by
reason of the greater activity of the enemy than at
Suvla and Anzac, but also because the enemy having
been successfully hoodwinked on the former occasion it
hardly appeared probable that we should be so successful
a second time in masking our intentions.</p>

<p>Another very severe storm broke over Cape Helles
on the 21st December, accompanied by heavy rain, and
one of the 2/4th London machine-guns was struck by
lightning in the trenches. It became evident that with
the likelihood of an early complete break up in the weather
the final evacuation must not be delayed; and accordingly
it was fixed for the 8th January 1916, or the first
fine night after that date.</p>

<p>On the 21st Lieut. L. A. Dickins was seriously wounded
and evacuated from the Peninsula. This tour of duty
indeed proved the most costly in personnel which the
Battalion had carried out, and among N.C.O.'s and men
4 were killed and 13 wounded.</p>

<p>On the 22nd the 1st R.N. Brigade made a further
"side-step" to the right in the trenches, and in the course
of the readjustment A and B Companies of the 2/4th
Londons were relieved in the trenches and withdrew to a
fresh Rest Camp, called Cæsar's Camp. The rest of the
Battalion, however, remained in the Tranchée d'Amade
until after Christmas.</p>

<p>On the 23rd December 2/Lieut. C. S. G. Blows joined
the Battalion from England.</p>

<p>Owing to the kindness of Mrs Dunfee and other ladies
interested in the 2/4th Londons, Christmas gifts and cards
had been received for every member of the Battalion,
and these materially helped to infuse a little cheerfulness
into a somewhat depressing and comfortless Christmastide.
On Christmas Day the Battalion was practically complete
in the Tranchée d'Amade, B Company and two platoons
of A Company having moved forward once more from
Cæsar's Camp.</p>

<p>The general scheme for the evacuation of the Helles
front was similar to that employed at Anzac and Suvla,
and in the course of the second stage of the operation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
detachments of the 2/4th Londons, consisting of 63 other
ranks under Lieut. S. N. Davies and 50 other ranks under
2/Lieut. S. Davis were embarked for Mudros on the night
of the 31st December. These were followed the next
night by 5 officers and 147 other ranks under Capt.
R. N. Keen.</p>

<p>On the 3rd January 1916, the machine-guns of the
Battalion, now increased to six, were evacuated in charge
of a N.C.O. and two men, and on the following day the
last battle casualties occurred, three men being slightly
wounded in the Rest Camp.</p>

<p>The preparations for final evacuation were now
practically complete. A strong embarkation staff had
been formed to deal with the rapid embarkation of the
last troops as they should reach the beaches; and new
lines of defence guarding the beaches had been prepared
for occupation in case the enemy should become aware
of the operation and harass it.</p>

<p>On the night of the 6th/7th January, a fourth detachment
of 4 officers and 118 other ranks of the Battalion
under Capt. Arthur left the Peninsula, and the next night
Major Seyd in command of the remainder of the Battalion
(8 officers and 155 other ranks) embarked at V Beach.
This completed the safe evacuation of the whole Battalion
with the exception of four men who were left behind
attached to the "Dumeszyl Battery" under Commander
Alan Campbell, R.N.D. (since killed), for demolition work.
After completion of their hazardous duties all the members
of this brave unit were also safely embarked.</p>

<p>The total strength of the Battalion on evacuating the
Peninsula (including the transport and other details who
had remained at Mudros and Imbros) was 23 officers and
about 560 other ranks. The total casualties sustained
at the hands of the enemy had been 2 officers wounded,
16 N.C.O.'s and men killed and 38 wounded, the remaining
reduction of strength having been due to sickness and
exposure.</p>

<p>On the 7th January the enemy opened an intense
bombardment, said to be the heaviest since the original
landing in April 1915, on our trenches; the shelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
lasting from noon till 3.30 p.m., at which time two Turkish
mines were sprung near Fusilier Bluff. No attack developed
except at this point, where a half-hearted advance
of the enemy was easily dispersed.</p>

<p>The 8th January was calm and still, but at night the
weather became stormy, and a steady and increasing
swell did not tend to facilitate the task of rapid embarkation,
and indeed rendered it very doubtful whether it
would be possible to get the last troops away at all. This
caused considerable anxiety to the Embarkation Staff
whose task was not lightened by the knowledge of the
presence of an enemy submarine which (unsuccessfully)
torpedoed H.M.S. <em>Prince George</em>. Add to this the possibility
that the enemy might discover the retirement in
time to give trouble on the beaches; and it will be possible
in at least a small measure to appreciate the great skill
with which this apparently impracticable task was brought
to a successful issue. By 3.30 a.m. the evacuation was
completed and at 4 a.m. two of our magazines were blown
up. The conflagration caused by these appears to have
been the first intimation of our departure received by
the Turks who promptly shelled our vacated lines heavily
until 6.30 a.m.</p>

<p>All material was removed except a few unserviceable
guns, some 500 animals and a large quantity of stores,
all of which were destroyed.</p>

<p>It is impossible to refrain from remarking on the
excellent organisation and discipline with which the
evacuation was carried out, and also on the extraordinary
luck which was vouchsafed both at Anzac and Suvla in the
concealment of the moon.</p>

<p>The Gallipoli expedition must live for ever in the
annals of the world's military history, as one of the most
remarkable exploits ever carried out. Although failure
ensued, it was indeed a glorious failure, and the wonder
is rather that success was so nearly attained. The base
of operations at Alexandria was 800 miles distant, and the
lines of communication possessed only two inadequate
and unprotected harbours at Mudros and Imbros respectively.
The whole occupied zone, and also the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
in its vicinity, was all the time under hostile observation
and fire; there were no roads worthy of the name, no
storehouses or railways, and the activity of enemy
submarines made it impossible to send to the Peninsula
any store-ship over 1500 tons.</p>

<p>Yet in the face of all these obstacles not only was the
landing effected, but our position maintained for nearly
nine months and the whole force safely re-embarked;
and the memory of it must live for ever as one of the
greatest pages of the history of the war.</p>

<p>After the evacuation, an appreciative order was
published in R.N. Divisional Orders complimenting the
troops on the discipline and devotion which had sustained
them during the hardships of the campaign, and
which alone had rendered the task of evacuation possible
of accomplishment. General Paris, commanding the
Division, wrote personally to the Commanding Officer
a letter in which he said: "I must thank you and your
Battalion for the good work you did when with us on the
Peninsula, we all admired the cheerful spirit your men
showed under very trying circumstances."</p>

<p>At Mudros the connection of the 2/4th Londons with
the Royal Naval Division was severed, and they became
temporarily attached to the 29th Division. A few days
were spent on the island in rest and reorganisation, and
during its stay there the Battalion was rejoined by the
Transport Section and other details who had been detached
from it during its duty at the Dardanelles; and
a great deal of satisfaction was caused by the distribution
of mails from home, the delivery of which had been
delayed by the evacuation.</p>

<p>On the 11th January Capt. R. N. Keen was admitted
to hospital, and on the 14th Sergt. F. W. Walker left
the Battalion for England to take up a commission. The
record of this N.C.O. will be referred to again later in
connection with the 3/4th Battalion to which he was
subsequently attached.</p>

<p>The Battalion embarked on H.T. <em>Ionian</em> for Alexandria
on the 18th, arriving there three days later. Disembarkation
took place on the following day, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Battalion entrained to Wardan, a camping ground near
Cairo, where it took up quarters under canvas and became
attached with the other three London Battalions to the
53rd Division, Major-Gen. A. G. Dallas, C.B., in command.
At Wardan company training was carried out
until the 16th February, when the 2/4th Londons, with
two companies of the 2/2nd Londons attached, moved by
rail to Beni Mazar, where it became part of the Minia
Force.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the period of the 2/4th Londons' return to Egypt
the Eastern frontier, on which the Turks had attempted
to force the Suez Canal defences about a year previously,
had become quiet, and the principal cause of anxiety
centred in the Western Desert where the attitude of the
Senussi, a warlike tribe of Arabs, had created a situation
of some difficulty, which was rendered more complex by
the possibility of internal disorders and religious unrest
in the Nile Valley and the Delta district.</p>

<p>On the outbreak of war between England and Turkey
the Senussi had not at first shown any disposition towards
hostile action, but under the influence of a Germanised
Turk named Gaafer Pasha they had become more truculent
as the summer of 1915 wore on. Several breaches of the
peace which occurred in the autumn left no room for
doubt that military operations would be necessary to
bring the Senussi to a due sense of their proper behaviour.</p>

<p>In November 1915 Lieut.-Gen. Sir John Maxwell,
commanding in chief the forces in Egypt, concentrated
the Western Force at Mersa Matruh, a town on the Mediterranean
coast some 180 miles west of Alexandria.
Under Maj.-Gen. Wallace, C.B., to whom command of
the Mersa Matruh troops was given, several vigorous
little operations were successfully carried out against the
tribesmen; but the lack of camel transport and water
supply arrangements restricted the scope of his activities.
Preparations were therefore made to remedy these defects
and thus render possible the despatch of a serious punitive
expedition into the desert.</p>

<p>On the 11th February a newly concentrated force of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the Senussi occupied the Baharia Oasis, and on the 27th
of the same month they also seized the Farafra and
Dakhla Oases. To combat the serious menace to the
Nile Valley offered by these fresh signs of activity, Sir
John Maxwell formed a new command, known as the
Southern Force, under Maj.-Gen. J. Adye, C.B., with
Headquarters at Beni Suef, a township on the Nile some
175 miles south of Cairo. This Southern Force was
concentrated in four distinct areas for the protection of
the Nile Valley and the cultivated areas, the three northern
areas respectively concentrated at Wadi Natrun, Beni
Salama and the Fayoum, being grouped under command
of Maj.-Gen. Dallas; the fourth and southernmost being
located in the Minia and Assiut provinces under Brig.-Gen.
A. Stirling.</p>

<p>General Stirling's Minia Force was being concentrated
at the period when the 2/4th Londons joined it, and
comprised the following formations:</p>

<div class="center">
<ul>
  <li>Highland Mounted Brigade (dismounted).</li>
  <li>1st Australian Light Horse Brigade.</li>
  <li>One squadron of Cavalry (Egyptian Army).</li>
  <li>Detachment of R.F.C. with two Aeroplanes.</li>
  <li>Nos. 1 and 2 Armoured Trains.</li>
  <li>1/4th Glamorgan Battery R.F.A.</li>
  <li>One section Hong-Kong Mountain Battery.</li>
  <li>2/1st Cheshire Field Company R.E.</li>
  <li>2/4th London Regiment.</li>
  <li>Two Companies 2/2nd London Regiment,</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>and was subsequently increased by the arrival of further
units as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<ul>
  <li>One squadron Armoured Cars R.N. Division.</li>
  <li>Half section Camel Transport Corps.</li>
  <li>One Company Australian Camel Corps.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In spite of the great strategic importance of the Oases
it was found impossible at the moment to undertake
active operations, and the activities of the Minia Force
were therefore confined to defensive measures. The
whole Nile Valley at this time was infected by powerful
religious and political influences which were at work to
endeavour to induce the native population to co-operate
with the enemy against the British, and although these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
influences had not attained the success hoped for by
their instigators, they had taken a certain hold on all
classes of the civilian population. It was, therefore,
extremely important to counterbalance this smouldering
agitation by the presence of strong military forces in
provincial stations, primarily to prevent the occurrence
of disturbances which might be fomented in the absence
of troops, and to safeguard points of military importance,
such as railway stations, bridges and canals. The natives
of Egypt, though not of warlike character, are capable
of violent fanatical outbursts, and the continued presence
of the military, combined with frequent displays of their
force, was the best means of preventing altogether disturbances
which might assume very serious proportions.</p>

<p>Such was briefly the position of affairs at the period
of the 2/4th Londons' attachment to the Minia Force,
but shortly after their arrival a distinct improvement in
the outlook was caused by the dispersal of the Senussi
forces in the battle of Agagia on the 26th February 1916.
This time it was possible to exploit the success, and the
desert column pushed forward to Sollum which was
occupied on the 14th March. The effect of this signal
success on British prestige throughout Egypt was marked,
and this effect was enhanced by the continued failure of
the Turks to make any impression in the East on the
Suez Canal defences. The Senussi forces were now
practically disposed of, only about 3000 remaining in the
field, and this remnant appeared to be disheartened,
while the reputation of their commander, Sayed Ahmed,
both as a temporal leader and a spiritual guide, had
waned.</p>

<p>The danger, however, was by no means past, and the
occupation by the Senussi of the Baharia Oasis, which
followed soon after the battle of Agagia, created a serious
menace to the part of the Nile Valley for which the Minia
Force was responsible.</p>

<p>The Minia District includes about 65 miles of a strip
of cultivated land running north and south along the
left bank of the Nile, varying in width from 7 to 14 miles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
This area is intersected for irrigation purposes by numerous
canals of which the largest, Bahr Yusef, runs roughly
parallel to the Nile near the western edge of the cultivated
strip. Beyond it sand-dunes run for some two miles into
the desert. Minia itself is a town of some importance,
containing about 35,000 inhabitants. The loot to be
obtained from its banks and merchants, as well as the
possibility of obtaining recruits from the Bedouin population,
and the certainty of creating a strong anti-British
influence, seemed to offer considerable inducements to
raiding parties from the Baharia Oasis, and it was against
this danger that the protective measures of the Minia
Force were directed.</p>

<p>The troops at Beni Mazar, which is on the main railway
line 26 miles north of Minia, comprised the following:</p>

<div class="center">
<ul>
  <li>2/4th London Regiment.</li>
  <li>Two Companies 2/2nd London Regiment.</li>
  <li>One Camel Machine-Gun Section, Lovat's Scouts.</li>
  <li>One Troop Australian Light Horse.</li>
  <li>Detachment of Cheshire Field Company R.E.</li>
  <li>No. 2 Armoured Train.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>A detached post of one company of infantry (supplied
by 2/4th Londons) was furnished from Beni Mazar to
guard a bridge at Saqula over the Bahr Yusef. The
whole of the troops at Beni Mazar came under command
of A/Lieut.-Col. V. H. Seyd.</p>

<p>At Beni Mazar the 2/4th Londons settled down quickly
to their new surroundings and carried out company
training to the extent which the circumstances permitted.
The situation, however, placed a considerable restriction
on the activities of the Battalion in this direction, as it
was held at all times under instant readiness to move.
A good deal of attention was paid, nevertheless, to long
distance route marching with the deliberate intention of
hardening the troops in preparation for the possibility
of an advance against the Baharia Oasis.</p>

<p>On the 26th February a detachment of the 2/2nd
Londons proceeded to Nag Hamadi to guard the Nile
bridgehead there. Col. Dunfee this day returned from
leave and took over once more the command of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Battalion and of the forces at Beni Mazar, A/Lieut.-Col.
Seyd reverting to his former duties as second in command
with the rank of Major.</p>

<p>On the 28th and 29th trial runs were made on the
armoured train from Beni Mazar to Maghaga with the
double object of giving the troops practice in rapid entrainment
and of reminding the inhabitants of the presence
of British forces. A demonstration march was made
through the streets of Maghaga, but the demeanour of
the natives was found to be quite satisfactory. The
behaviour of the inhabitants of Beni Mazar also was so
peaceful at this time that it was found possible to relax
somewhat the strict orders as to permitting troops to
walk out in the town, and henceforth they were allowed
to walk in pairs instead of parties of six as had formerly
been the case, though side arms were still worn at all
times.</p>

<p>On the 1st March Capt. H. G. Stanham was appointed
to command the Saqula detachment.</p>

<p>The working hours of the Battalion at this period were
early in the day, owing to the advance of the hot season,
but in spite of the severe change from the trying conditions
to which it had been subjected at Cape Helles two months
earlier, the Battalion showed a remarkably good bill of
health.</p>

<p>At the beginning of March the command in chief in
Egypt was assumed by Sir Archibald Murray, and in the
rearrangement of the defensive forces in the Nile Valley
which ensued, the Beni Mazar troops ceased to form part
of the Minia Force, which was extended farther to the
south, and became attached to the Northern Force
(Southern Area) under Maj.-Gen. Dallas.</p>

<p>On the 3rd and 5th of March practice alarms took
place and the Beni Mazar Force moved tactically to
Tambu, taking up a position there for the defence of the
railway. The strength of the 2/4th Londons on parade
at the second alarm was 16 officers and 450 other ranks.</p>

<p>Throughout the period of the 2/4th Londons' occupation
of Beni Mazar they received the greatest possible
attention and kindness from the local Egyptian residents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
who overwhelmed them with presents of eggs, fowls,
turkeys, sheep, cigarettes, fruit and other "consumable
stores," which needless to say were gratefully received
as a pleasant alternative to rations. The officers of the
Battalion were constantly entertained by the local
dignitaries, who extended to them all the hospitality in
their power, and among whom must be mentioned
Mahomed Marzouk, Mamur Markaz, Merza Mohed Ali
F. Bey, Abdul Gawad, Mahomed Zubi Abd el Razech,
Ahmed H. el Keesz and H. Abd el Rezik.</p>

<p>On the 6th April the Saqula detachment was withdrawn
and on the 12th the Battalion left Beni Mazar,
handing over duties to the 2/5th Devonshire Regiment.
The Battalion strength, 23 officers and 586 other ranks,
proceeded by train <em>via</em> Cairo and Alexandria, travelling
all night, and detrained the following day at Sidi Gaber,
marching to quarters under canvas at Sidi Bishr. Here
the 2/1st London Infantry Brigade came together again
as a Brigade for the first time since its occupation of
Malta, under the command of Col. Dunfee.</p>

<p>On the 17th April the Brigade embarked at Alexandria
on H.T. <em>Transylvania</em> which carried in addition to the
Brigade, detachments of Colonial and Imperial troops,
totalling together 130 officers and about 3000 other ranks.
The following appointments were made on H.T.
<em>Transylvania</em>:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="appointments">
  <tr>
    <td>O.C. Ship&mdash;Col. Vickers Dunfee, V.D.</td>
    <td rowspan="2" class="bl">2/4th London Regiment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ship's Adjutant&mdash;Capt. J. R. Webster</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

<p>On the 18th the <em>Transylvania</em> left Alexandria and
during the passage all possible precautions were taken
against submarine attack. No untoward incident however
occurred, and on the 24th April the transport
arrived at Marseilles and disembarkation at once took
place.</p>

<p>The Battalion entrained immediately for Rouen,
arriving on the 26th April, and was accommodated in
the Bruyères Camp.</p>

<p>On arrival at Rouen the 2/1st London Infantry Brigade
was finally disbanded after having been in existence for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
about nineteen months. Col. Dunfee, on the break-up
of the Brigade, once more assumed command of the
Battalion, but its remaining life as a separate unit proved
to be short.</p>

<p>The wastage which had inevitably taken place in the
ranks of the 1/4th Battalion (which had now been in
France for over fifteen months) had been far beyond the
capacity of the Reserve Battalion at home to replace;
and with the certain prospect of being called on to fill
serious deficiencies to be caused by the large numbers of
additional casualties which were expected in the great
battle destined to open on 1st July, it was decided by the
War Office to disband finally all the units formerly comprising
the 2/1st London Infantry Brigade, and to use
these troops for the purpose of reinforcing their first
line battalions.</p>

<p>The dispersal of the 2/4th Battalion at Rouen is therefore
the last incident to be recorded in its separate history.</p>

<p>Owing to the exigencies of the campaign it was impossible
to grant leave to more than a very small proportion
of the Battalion in spite of its prolonged absence
from the United Kingdom, and drafts were quickly sent
up the line beginning on the 5th May. By the 20th June
the whole strength of the Battalion in officers, N.C.O.'s
and men, with a few exceptions, had been despatched
to the 1/4th Londons, in the history of which the arrival
of these drafts will be noted in detail in their place.</p>

<p>The officers sent to other units were:</p>

<p>Capts. W. H. S. Stevens and W. N. Towse, Lieut. R. C.
Dickins, and 2/Lieuts. G. F. Bishop and H. W. Dennis
to 1/21st London Regiment (47th Division).</p>

<p>Hon. Lieut, and Q.M. J. E. W. Lambley to XV Corps,
A.C.C.</p>

<p>A draft of 133 other ranks was sent to the Kensingtons
(13th London), but by the intervention of Lieut.-Col.
Wheatley they were subsequently secured for the 1/4th
Londons. Col. Vickers Dunfee was attached to 1/22nd
London Regiment (The Queens) for some two months,
after which he returned to England to command the
4th (Reserve) Battalion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus ends the separate record of the first reserve
Battalion raised by the 4th London Regiment during the
war. Although the 2/4th Battalion ceased to exist as
a unit, the services rendered by its personnel in the first
line battalion were of a very high order, and the reinforcements
composed by it were particularly welcome
inasmuch as they afforded a large number of much needed
non-commissioned officers, who were quickly given an
opportunity to prove their value in the battles on the
Somme later in the year.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

THE 3/4TH AND 4/4TH BATTALIONS AT HOME</h2>


<p>At home 1915 and 1916 were two years of hard work
in developing the organisation of the Regiment to enable
it to provide the reinforcements necessary for the maintenance
in the field of its overseas battalions.</p>

<p>Prior to the war the 4th London Regiment&mdash;like all
other Territorial formations&mdash;had no reserve cadre which
was capable of being expanded into a reserve unit on
mobilisation; and when therefore the 2/4th Battalion
followed the 1/4th Battalion overseas in December 1914
the need of providing means of "feeding" the fighting
battalions with fresh personnel became pressing.
The records of the home battalions are necessarily
lacking in the exciting incidents with which those of
the service battalions are crowded; but they represent an
enormous amount of labour carried out under conditions
of great difficulty, and as a rule with very little recognition
of their vital importance to the continued existence of the
Regiment during the War.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made in Chapter II to
the steps taken to raise a third line battalion under Major
E. H. Stillwell on the departure of the 2/4th Battalion
for Malta. This new Battalion, the 3/4th London
Regiment, secured recruits rapidly, and, like its predecessor,
very quickly outgrew the limits of Headquarters
at Hoxton. It was therefore moved early in January
to Littlegrove and Beech Hill, the two houses at Barnet
which had previously been occupied by the battalion
raised by Col. Dunfee. A slight stiffening of the ranks
was supplied by a few members of the overseas battalions
who had received a good deal of training with them
but had been found medically unfit to accompany them
abroad; but the vast majority of the officers, non-commissioned
officers and men had but recently joined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
most of them without any previous experience of soldiering.
No member of the new Battalion, moreover, had
seen service in the War, and the magnitude of the task
imposed on the officers and warrant officers of instilling
the rudiments of discipline into so unwieldy a mass of
men was no light one. The enthusiasm of the early days
of the War, had, however, by no means subsided, and all
ranks worked with a will; and before long the Battalion,
now about 600 strong, began to find its feet.</p>

<p>On the 8th February 1915 Capt. P. S. Cookson (late
Royal Sussex Regiment) was appointed to command the
Battalion with the temporary rank of Lieut.-Col. with
Major W. H. Hamilton as second in command, and Major
E. V. Wellby as Adjutant. The company commanders
were Capts. A. A. N. Hayne, S. W. J. Limpenny, E. D.
Wilson and A. E. Wood.</p>

<p>The training facilities which had been extended to
the 2/4th Battalion by local residents at Barnet were
accorded to the 3/4th Battalion also, and the training of
recruits under company arrangements proceeded as
rapidly as possible and as efficiently as the circumstances
permitted. No time indeed was to be lost for the 1/4th
Londons were now in France, and as already described
began to suffer battle casualties early in March 1915;
so that it was clear that the 3/4th Battalion might at any
time be called upon to make up its deficiencies. Towards
the end of April it was in fact called on to supply the
first reinforcement, and accordingly despatched 2 officers
and 50 other ranks who, as referred to in Chapter IV,
joined the 1/4th Londons in the Ypres Salient.</p>

<p>Third line battalions had also been formed by the other
regiments of the 1st London Brigade, and hitherto these
had been distributed over a wide area on the outskirts
of London; but in the last week of April the four new
battalions were concentrated under canvas at Tadworth
(Surrey) as the 3/1st London Brigade, under the command
of Col. H. C. Cholmondely, C.B. The 3/4th Battalion
joined the Brigade on the 26th April.</p>

<p>On the 5th May the Adjutancy was taken over by
Capt. E. E. Spicer with Lieut S. H. Stedman as Assistant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Adjutant, Major E. V. Wellby having transferred to the
1st London Regiment.</p>

<p>Early in June 1915 a general reconstruction was
effected in the reserve and training cadres at home; and
a number of fresh battalions were formed composed
largely of personnel who were not medically fit to serve
overseas. To this end a composite Battalion, known as
the 100th Provisional Battalion, was formed of officers,
N.C.O.'s and men of the 3/1st London Brigade. On the
2nd June Capt. A. E. Wood, and 2/Lieuts. E. J. Bennet
and J. S. B. Gathergood and about 100 N.C.O.'s and men
left the 3/4th Battalion at Tadworth to join the 100th
Provisional Battalion which was stationed at Aldeburgh.
On the same day Major W. H. Hamilton was appointed
to raise, equip and train a new Battalion, to be known
as the 4/4th London Regiment.</p>

<p>Concurrently with this development the 3/1st London
Brigade moved from Tadworth to billets at Bury St
Edmunds. Here training was proceeded with, and the
battalions of the Brigade were again opened for recruiting
to make good the gaps in their ranks caused by the formation
of the Provisional Battalion.</p>

<p>In the following month a further move took place,
and the 3/1st London Brigade took over billets in Ipswich.
A further step was now made in the organisation of the
Home Forces and towards the end of August all personnel
of the Provisional Battalion except "home-service" men
were returned to their units. The 2/2nd and 2/3rd London
Infantry Brigades had also been concentrated in the
Ipswich area, and a new Division&mdash;the 58th&mdash;was now
formed as a Service Division; and the duty of "draft-finding"
for the whole Regiment henceforth devolved
solely on the 4/4th Battalion under Major Hamilton.</p>

<p>The composition of the 58th Division was as follows:</p>

<p>The duties of second in command were now taken by
Major E. D. Wilson, who continued to occupy this appointment
for some months till he was appointed to
Brigade Staff and subsequently to Southern Command
Headquarters. He was succeeded as second in command
by Capt. A. A. N. Hayne.</p>

<p>The constant changes of station to which the 3/4th
Battalion had been subjected during its short existence
had, as will be readily appreciated, a somewhat deleterious
effect on its training and general discipline. Prolonged
life in billets is, moreover, highly unsuitable for young
troops under training, and the general effect of the
Division's stay in Ipswich was not altogether beneficial.
All units were similarly affected. The dispatch of the
Division overseas was in consequence delayed, and the
troops began to become stale with "over-training."
Throughout 1915 and the early months of 1916 this unsatisfactory
state of affairs continued, and the routine
of training, now become wearying through its monotonous
repetition, was broken only by the occasional passing
excitement of air raids, of which the eastern counties saw
a good deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>During February 1916, recruits called up under the
"Derby" scheme to the number of 359 were posted to
the Battalion and their training proceeded with all possible
speed. Owing, however, to the need for bringing them
into line with the remainder of the Battalion in view of
the possibility of its being sent to the front during 1916,
the training of these men was expedited by temporarily
attaching a part of the Battalion to the 4/4th Battalion
in order to ease the duties of the training staff.</p>

<p>In June the billets in Ipswich were vacated, and the
Division removed to quarters under canvas at Blackrock
Camp outside the town, where the former routine was
resumed.</p>

<p>In these somewhat unhappy circumstances we may
leave the 3/4th Battalion and return to trace the growth
of the 4/4th Battalion which had sprung from it at
Tadworth a year previously.</p>

<p>The following officers accompanied Major Hamilton to
Headquarters and were posted to the 4/4th Battalion:
Capt. and Adjt. W. G. Hayward, Lieut. H. E. Miller, and
2/Lieuts. W. H. Vernon and H. J. M. Williams. Hon.
Lieut. J. S. Fullalove (late Devonshire Regiment) was
appointed Quartermaster, and Coy. Sergt.-Major Potton
(late 1/4th Londons) to be Regimental Sergt.-Major. The
Commanding Officer was fortunate in enlisting into the
Battalion as Warrant Officers and senior N.C.O.'s several
ex-Guardsmen and members of the City Police Force,
including Coy. Sergt.-Majors H. W. Dennis and J. Pearson,
and C.Q.M.-Sergts. A. Reed and F. Milne. These experienced
soldiers formed the nucleus of what afterwards
became a very fine staff of instructors.</p>

<p>The new Battalion shortly after its inception became
the draft-finding unit for the first and second line battalions
in the field, and also the unit by which wounded and invalided
officers, N.C.O.'s and men of the regiment from
the front were re-equipped and passed through a "refresher"
course of training, pending their return to the
front as reinforcements.</p>

<p>The Battalion was accordingly organised in three
Companies, A and B (respectively under Capts. W. Moore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
and F. C. Grimwade) being for the reception and training
of recruits; and C (under Lieut. D. C. Cooke) being
the "expeditionary" Company, the personnel being all
N.C.O.'s and men returned from the B.E.F. Lieut.
F. A. Coffin succeeded Capt Hayward as Adjutant, the
latter taking over the duties of President of the Regimental
Institutes.</p>

<p>Just previously to the formation of the Battalion the
forces in the field had suffered immense casualties at
Ypres and on the Gallipoli Peninsula; and the full weight
of the German offensive on the Eastern Front where the
Russians were steadily giving ground was making itself
felt. Earl Kitchener had issued his second call for more
men, and recruiting was proceeding rapidly for all branches
of the Service; and within a month of its formation some
600 recruits had been posted to the 4/4th Battalion, while
the ranks of the Expeditionary Company were rapidly
swelling with returning casualties from Neuve Chapelle
and Ypres.</p>

<p>It being obviously impossible to cope with the task
of dealing with such great numbers in the cramped
accommodation at Headquarters arrangements were made
for taking over the billets at New Barnet, previously
occupied by the 2/4th and 3/4th Battalions; and the
Battalion moved to its new quarters on the 12th July,
Headquarters and A Company being billeted at Littlegrove
and B and C Companies at Beech Hill.</p>

<p>A vigorous programme of training was at once put in
hand, the work being carried out at Folly Farm and, by
the kindness of Sir Philip Sassoon, in Trent Park. Through
the generosity of the Club Committee the full resources
of the Enfield Rifle Club were again placed at the disposal
of the Battalion, and it is hard to overestimate the value
of the assistance rendered in the musketry training of the
recruits by the many public-spirited members of the Club
who volunteered their services as instructors.</p>

<p>Owing to the continued influx of recruits, the training
companies having now each a strength of about 380, it
was necessary to take over additional billets at Oakhill
which were allotted to the Expeditionary Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in August, almost before the recruit training
was under way, orders were received to prepare a draft of
400 other ranks to proceed, at three days' notice, to Malta
to join the 2/4th Battalion. After considerable exertion the
draft was equipped, fitted with khaki drill uniforms and
sun-helmets, and in due course proceeded to Southampton,
where it actually embarked on the transport. The
orders for its departure were, however, cancelled, and
the draft returned to Barnet to resume its training in
the 4/4th Battalion, much to the disappointment of the
N.C.O.'s and men concerned.</p>

<p>The supplies of webbing equipment having proved
inadequate, the troops were now being provided with
leather equipment of the 1915 pattern; and were armed
with the long pattern charger-loading Lee-Enfield rifle.
At this date the training of recruits proceeded under no
efficient system such as was evolved at a later date. No
set period was allowed for the preparation of the drafts,
and very few facilities were provided for improving or
speeding-up training beyond such as emanated from
the brains of the officers and N.C.O.'s immediately concerned,
with the inevitable result that a good deal of
unnecessary delay and a certain lack of uniformity in
the training ensued. Thanks, however, to the devoted
efforts of the instructors, the recruits soon passed the
initial stages and were passed as "trained" men on
a syllabus which included drill, musketry, marching,
physical training and bayonet fighting, entrenching,
field work and the rudiments of bomb-throwing. The
first draft of N.C.O.'s and men supplied by the Battalion
consisting of 40 other ranks under Lieut. N. L. Thomas
and 2/Lieuts. S. Davis, J. W. Price and C. S. G. Blows
proceeded to the Dardanelles to join the 2/4th Battalion
at the beginning of November 1915.</p>

<p>Recruiting had continued at a great speed during
the months of July, August and September, and the
training companies had assumed such unmanageable
proportions that they were subdivided and a new training
company, C, under Major H. J. Duncan-Teape, was
formed, the Expeditionary Company being renamed D.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 29th August 1915 the Battalion was visited
by the following ex-officers of the Regiment:</p>

<div class="center">
<ul>
  <li>Lieut.-Col. E. T. Rodney Wilde, V.D.</li>
  <li>Lieut.-Col. Harry Dade, V.D.</li>
  <li>Lieut.-Col. A. H. Lock, V.D.</li>
  <li>Major P. Lynch, and</li>
  <li>Major W. Stevens.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>On this occasion Church Parade was held at Folly
Farm, after which the Battalion marched past the
ex-officers, the salute being taken by Lieut.-Col.
Dade.</p>

<p>On the 13th November an inter-company relief took
place, A Company moving to Beech Hill, and its billets
at Littlegrove being occupied by B Company.</p>

<p>At Christmas 48 hours' leave was granted to every
member of the Battalion, two leave parties being formed
for the purpose.</p>

<p>During this period the Reserve Battalions of the 1st
London Division were stationed in all parts of the Home
Counties, and the supervision of training by those responsible
was naturally extremely difficult; and it was
consequently decided to bring together all these battalions
into one Divisional camp, the site selected being near
Salisbury Plain.</p>

<p>The move to Salisbury took place in January 1916,
the 4/4th Battalion proceeding on the 11th to No. 7 Camp,
Hurdcott (between Salisbury and Shaftesbury), where it
found itself for the first time in company with the 4/1st,
4/2nd, and 4/3rd Battalions, the remainder of the Division
being quartered at Hurdcott and Fovant.</p>

<p>No troops of the 4th London Regiment were after
this date quartered at Barnet, but before finally saying
farewell to this the first station of so many hundreds of
the members of the Regiment, we must once more express
the indebtedness of the Regiment not only to those
gentlemen who so generously afforded the Battalion the
use of such excellent training grounds, but also to Mr
Kingwell and Mr W. H. Vernon, the owners respectively
of Beech Hill and Littlegrove, for the pains taken by
them to render these houses comfortable for the troops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
and to the many local residents who extended kindness
and hospitality to the Battalion, among whom Mr Eldred
of Cockfosters must not be forgotten.</p>

<p>About this time the designation of the Battalion was
changed to the 4th (Reserve) Battalion London Regiment,
a corresponding alteration being made in the titles of
the other 4th and 3rd line battalions of the Division.</p>

<p>Major H. J. Duncan-Teape assumed the duties of
second in command in January 1916.</p>

<p>The immediate result of the move to Salisbury Plain
was an immense strengthening of the <em>esprit-de-corps</em> of
the Battalion which now found itself for the first time
together in one camp, and a considerable increase of
efficiency and improvement in discipline followed. The
Hurdcott camps were arranged on suitably designed
principles with well ventilated sleeping huts and roomy
messing and recreation rooms which contributed in no
small degree to the comfort and physical welfare of the
troops. The 4th (Reserve) Battalion was, moreover,
exceptionally fortunate in becoming the possessor of an
excellent training and sports ground some 5 acres in
extent. Work was immediately set in hand to construct
a bayonet fighting assault course and a bombing ground,
and considerable improvements were made in the practice
trenches which had been left in a half-completed condition
by the former occupants of the camp.</p>

<p>The 3rd line Division now came under the command
of Col. Williams, C.B. (late Somerset Light Infantry),
who was succeeded in the command in May by Col. S. H.
Godman, D.S.O. (Scots Guards), whose kindly personality
will be held in grateful remembrance by all who came
into personal touch with him.</p>

<p>Voluntary recruiting had come almost to a standstill
during the preceding December, and the training of
all the N.C.O.'s and men who had joined the Battalion
previously was now practically completed. Numerous
drafts had been sent out to the 1/4th Battalion in France,
and the activities of the training staff of the Battalion
were therefore somewhat restricted. But in March the
whole of the training reserve camps in England became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
veritable hives of activity; for in that month the first
groups of men enlisted under the "Derby" scheme of
recruiting were called up, and were posted to their respective
home training battalions.</p>

<p>The recruits allotted to the Regiment under this
scheme were clothed at Headquarters (though not equipped
or armed) and drafted straight to Hurdcott, and within
the space of a week no fewer than 650 were posted to the
4th (Reserve) Battalion. In the following week a party
of 220 N.C.O.'s and men of the 3/4th Battalion were
sent to the 4th (Reserve) Battalion for the completion of
their training, which was found on examination to be in
a variety of stages of advancement.</p>

<p>It will be readily appreciated that the sudden advent
of so large a body of totally untrained men strained the
instructional facilities of the Battalion to the utmost,
and it was deemed advisable somewhat to modify the
system of training which had proved sufficient hitherto.
The recruits were posted to companies as usual, an extra
company, E (under Lieut. Miller), being now formed,
but the company staffs assumed responsibility only for
clothing, equipment, messing, pay and other administrative
and disciplinary duties, the whole of the training
being entrusted to a specially selected staff of officers
and N.C.O. instructors, who were as far as possible relieved
of company and battalion duties. It is believed
that the Battalions of the London Reserve Division were
among the first to adopt this system of coping with the
problem of draft-production which, in modified and improved
forms, gradually became recognised as the most
efficient and was generally adopted.</p>

<p>It should be understood that the brief description
which follows of the work of the Reserve Battalion is
somewhat anticipatory. The scheme of training which
was in force in the last year of the War was obviously not
evolved in a day, but was the fruit of three years' experience.
But it is thought that the present is perhaps the
most suitable juncture for the inclusion in this history of
these notes, as the period now under review saw the
inception of the great training scheme whereby the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
produced its citizen soldiers who fought the great battles
of 1916, 1917 and 1918.</p>

<p>The system as originally evolved in the 4th Battalion
was intended to apply to "barrack-square" instruction
in drill only, but as training proceeded, it was found
desirable not only to ensure uniformity of instruction,
but also for economy of instructors and the avoidance
of delay in the completion of training, to apply it to all
branches of training. "Specialist" officers and N.C.O.'s
were therefore appointed to take charge of each different
subject of instruction, such as drill, musketry, bombing,
Lewis Gun, physical training and bayonet fighting, entrenching
and wiring, and "anti-gas" measures; the
whole training school being under the executive control
of an "officer in charge of training."</p>

<p>This development was made the more desirable inasmuch
as the War Office now was tightening up the whole
system of training, in view of the continued heavy
casualties at the front which rendered necessary not only
the fullest and quickest possible development of the
untrained man-power of the Empire, but also the regular
and rapid filling up of deficiencies in the ranks of the
fighting troops. Under the War Office scheme (the
wisdom of which is demonstrated by the fact that in
broad principle it remained unaltered until the Armistice,
modification only being found desirable in matters of
detail) the period allowed for the conversion of the recruit
into a trained soldier was fourteen weeks. This period
was subdivided with considerable skill and foresight, the
first two weeks being occupied in completing the equipment
of the recruit, coupled with light drill and physical
training, together with lectures on a few general subjects
with the object of gradually settling him into his new
conditions of life, and to allow for his complete recovery
from the effects of "anti-typhoid" inoculation. The
serious training of the recruit therefore lasted twelve
weeks, which in the 1st London (Reserve) Brigade were
subdivided into two distinct periods. The first of these
concerned the "individual" training of the recruit in
the subjects to which reference has been made above,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
and which lasted for ten weeks. It was proceeded with
in accordance with War Office instructions, which laid
down the number of hours to be devoted weekly to each
subject. During this period also the recruit was put
through a special table of musketry practices on the open
range, and it concluded with a series of tests of individual
proficiency in each subject, the passing of which decided
the recruit's claim to be classed as a trained soldier.</p>

<p>Throughout these three months the training proceeded
by platoons, each platoon of recruits living, messing and
working together, with the object of impressing on them,
from the earliest days of their service, the importance
of the platoon as a unit in action. The latter part of
the "individual" training period saw the sub-division
of each platoon into Lewis Gun and bombing sections,
training being arranged for in accordance with the
particular requirements of each. The "individual"
training having been completed, the final fortnight was
devoted to platoon "combined training" in field work
as a properly organised platoon, the men working in full
marching order, loaded to the weight which they would
be called upon to carry in the field. The physical strain
of the last fourteen days was undoubtedly considerable,
but the results attained by it were amply justified, not
only from the point of actual instruction imparted, but
also from that of the highly important question of selection
of N.C.O.'s, for each section of the platoon in "combined
training" was in charge of a recruit N.C.O., the specialist
instructor being attached merely for the purpose of
supervision.</p>

<p>On completion of this final and most interesting period
in the recruit's training, he proceeded on "draft-leave"
for four clear days, on return from which he was reported
as ready to proceed overseas, was medically inspected
and finally fitted out; and as a rule his departure overseas
ensued within a few days.</p>

<p>Such was the course of life in a Reserve Battalion, and
it will not be disputed that the duties of an instructor
were both multifarious and exceedingly onerous, while
the degree of personal application and physical endurance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
which the recruit himself was called upon to display was
severe to a degree. Owing to the frequent changes of
personnel among the N.C.O. instructors, it is impossible
to record the names of all those who were in turn employed
in this manner, but it would be unjust not to
acknowledge the splendid devotion of the training staffs
or to recognise with gratitude the extreme importance
of the rôle played by them in the War. Neither can we
refrain from remarking that, however complete the scheme
of training, and however efficient the instructors, it would
have been nearly impossible to carry it into effect in the
short period allowed but for the intense keenness and
willingness to learn displayed by the vast majority of the
many thousands of recruits who were trained in accordance
with it.</p>

<p>The instructors themselves were drawn entirely from
N.C.O.'s who had served with the 1st or 2nd line battalions
overseas, and had either been invalided to the United
Kingdom or were sent home for six months "on exchange."
In order to avoid staleness no instructor who
was fit for overseas service was permitted to retain his
appointment for more than one year, at the end of which
period he himself returned to the front as a reinforcement,
his place on the training staff being taken by one more
recently returned to England.</p>

<p>Officer instructors were selected and retained on a
similar principle, the period of appointment to the
establishment of a training reserve unit being (in the
case of physical fitness for service overseas) a maximum
of six months.</p>

<p>The officers of the first training staff appointed in
the 4th (Reserve) Battalion were:</p>

arrangements, the first Brigade Signalling Officer, 2/Lieut.
R. C. Hunt, being supplied by the 4th (Reserve) Battalion.</p>

<p>Early in February 1916 the 4th (Reserve) Battalion
received a very welcome reinforcement in the shape of
50 men of the Second Trinidad Contingent, and the honour
done to the Regiment in selecting it for the training of this
draft, representative of one of the smallest and yet most
ancient and loyal outposts of the Empire, was much
appreciated. About the same time four Trinidad officers,
2/Lieuts. L. Farfan, H. Dow, R. L. Fabien and J. MacDonald,
were gazetted to the Battalion. It was rapidly
realised that the difference of climate between the West
Indies and the snow-laden winds of the "Plain" was too
severe, and it became evident that this keen and efficient
platoon must be transferred to a more suitable environment.
After about six weeks with the 4th (Reserve)
Battalion, therefore, they were sent to complete their
training with the 7th Royal Fusiliers at Falmouth and
later attached to the 3/4th Devonshire Regiment in India.</p>

<p>In April Major H. J. Duncan-Teape rejoined the 1/4th
Battalion in France, the duties of second in command
being assumed by Major G. H. M. Vine.</p>

<p>During May the Battalion was inspected by Col. S. H.
Godman, D.S.O., commanding the Division, who presented
C. S. M. Risley, D.C.M., with his medal. The Battalion
also received a visit from Lieut.-Col. E. T. Rodney
Wilde, V.D. At the end of May the Division was reviewed
by Field-Marshal Earl French, commanding the Home
Forces.</p>

<p>Although the whole of the Battalions at Hurdcott
and Fovant Camps existed for the training of recruits
and were in no way formations which were likely to be
sent overseas as units, they were included in the scheme
which had been prepared for the defence of Great Britain
in the event of an attempt at landing by the Germans.</p>

<p>This scheme provided for the maintenance of a permanent
defence force on the East Coast and at other
points where it was deemed likely that any attempt at
invasion would be put into effect. In addition to this,
arrangements were made for the rapid concentration from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
other sources of a mobile force for use, in the event of
active operations taking place, as a general reserve. To
this general reserve the units of the 3rd line groups of
the 1st London Division contributed a quota of officers,
N.C.O.'s and men varying from time to time with the
numbers of men who were sufficiently advanced in their
course of training to render their inclusion in the force
useful.</p>

<p>During the period at Hurdcott frequent test concentrations
took place, in several instances the parade being
followed by a test route march. These parades were
always attended by the platoons of the 4th (Reserve)
Battalion detailed for the time being to this duty and
passed off satisfactorily.</p>

<p>On the 2nd June 1916 Major W. H. Hamilton, who
had commanded the Battalion since its formation, was
gazetted to the 4th Battalion Duke of Cornwall's Light
Infantry and almost immediately proceeded to join his
new Battalion at Meerut.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He was succeeded in temporary
command of the Battalion by Major G. H. M. Vine.
On the occasion of Major Hamilton's departure the troops
testified to their appreciation of his unfailing kindness and
sympathy with all ranks throughout the period of his
command by lining the camp road and heartily cheering
him as his car passed down it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Major Hamilton remained with the 4th D.C.L.I. until the following
year when he was attached to the 4th Hants Regiment. With this
Battalion he proceeded to Mesopotamia and took part in the victorious
advance which culminated in the occupation of Baghdad. He was later
appointed to command the detachment of the Hants Regiment which
accompanied the gallant little force led by General Dunsterville to
endeavour to secure the oilfield of Baku on the Caspian Sea.</p></div>

<p>In the latter part of July command of the Battalion
was assumed by Col. Vickers Dunfee, Major Vine resuming
the duties of second in command.</p>

<p>On the 1st July 1916 began the great series of battles
on the Somme, the Regiment's part in which will be
described, and almost immediately calls were made for
drafts of all ranks to fill the very serious gaps caused by
the heavy casualties sustained by the 1/4th Battalion
during the battle of Gommecourt; and between this date
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>and the middle of October when the 56th Division was
finally withdrawn from the Somme battles a total of some
30 officers and 400 other ranks were despatched. These
very heavy calls naturally depleted the ranks of the home
Battalion very seriously and took nearly all the "Derby"
recruits who had joined in the previous March.</p>

<p>With the object, apparently, of effecting an ultimate
economy in staff, a reorganisation of considerable importance
took place on the 1st September 1916 among the
whole of the 3rd line units of the Division. So far as
the Fusilier Brigade was concerned this took the form
of amalgamation of the four existing battalions into two,
the 1st and 2nd Battalions becoming the 1st (Reserve)
Battalion, and the 3rd and 4th Battalions becoming the
3rd (Reserve) Battalion. Each of these new battalions
for the time being retained a double establishment of
officers, warrant officers and N.C.O.'s and were organised
in eight companies till the despatch of personnel on
draft permitted a reduction to be made. The composite
battalion was made responsible for the provision of reinforcements
and for the reception of ranks returned from
overseas for each of the two Regiments of which it was
composed.</p>

<p>These amalgamations of necessity involved extensive
repostings of officers, in particular among those of senior
rank. Command of the new 3rd (Reserve) Battalion was
assumed by Lieut.-Col. T. Montgomerie Webb, formerly
commanding the old 3rd (Reserve) Battalion, Major
G. H. M. Vine being appointed second in command. The
duties of Adjutant, Quartermaster and Training Officer
respectively were also assumed by officers of the old 3rd
(Reserve) Battalion (namely, Capt. McGlashan, Capt.
Coombe and Major H. Moore, M.C.), the officers who had
previously held the corresponding appointments in the
old 4th (Reserve) Battalion being posted as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Capt, F. A. Coffin (Adjt.) to Brigade Staff.</p>

<p>Lieut. Fullalove (Q.M.) to new 6th (Reserve) Battalion.</p>

<p>Capt. F. C. Grimwade (Training Officer) to command A Company
new 3rd (Reserve) Battalion.</p></div>

<p>Col. Vickers Dunfee was appointed to command the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
new 1st (Reserve) Battalion, an appointment which he
retained until his demobilisation in December 1918.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the immediate result of this
amalgamation, involving as it did the extinction as a
separate entity of the 4th (Reserve) Battalion, was a
heavy blow to the <i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> of all ranks, which
was in the circumstances at least comprehensible. The
rank and file at a critical stage of their training came
under the command of officers and N.C.O. instructors
who were unknown to them, while the instructors of the
old 4th (Reserve) Battalion experienced a natural and
very keen disappointment at not being permitted to
complete the task to which they had applied themselves
with such devotion for many weeks past.</p>

<p>A closer acquaintance with the new surroundings,
however, resulted in a gradual disappearance of these
feelings of regret, and in due course a new <i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>
and a closer bond of union between the two Regiments
concerned took their place. At the end of its existence
in November 1918 the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion had become
an extremely happy one, in which no sort of distinction
existed between the 3rd and 4th London Regiments,
and each worked for the welfare of all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

THE FORMATION OF THE 56TH DIVISION</h2>


<p>From May onwards during the remainder of 1916 the
history of the Regiment in France is that of the 1/4th
Battalion, into which the 2/4th Battalion was merged;
and we may therefore proceed to follow its fortunes from
the date of its attachment to the newly formed 56th
Division.</p>

<p>At the date of the 1/4th Battalion's arrival in billets
at Citerne on the 9th February 1916, the 56th Division
was just being concentrated. The 47th Division, which
comprised chiefly battalions of the 2nd London Division
of pre-war days and which the Battalion had just left,
had joined the British Armies in France as a Division;
but the units of the old 1st London Division, which had
been among the first Territorial units to leave England,
had hitherto been scattered throughout the Army attached
to different regular divisions. The 56th, therefore, though
junior in precedence, owing to its comparatively late
formation, to many other Territorial Divisions which had
left England as complete organisations, consisted entirely
of battalions which might fairly be described as veteran,
since all had seen a good deal of stiff work up and down
the lines.</p>

<p>The infantry battalions were brigaded as follows:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><span class="smcap">56th (London) Division</span>&mdash;Major-Gen. Sir C. P. A. Hull, K.C.B.</dt>

    <dd>1/9th London (Queen Victoria Rifles).</dd>
    <dd>1/16th London (Queen's Westminster Rifles).</dd>
</dl>

<p>The Division was attached to the VI Corps (Keir) of
the Third Army (Allenby).</p>

<p>The record of the next three months may be passed
over quickly as they were devoted solely to organising
and training the new Division in areas well to the rear
of the trenches, and it was not until the early days of
May 1916 that the various units came under fire as a
Division. This prolonged period of rest, which indeed
was the longest ever spent in this manner by the Battalion
in the whole course of its active service history, was of
considerable importance in order that staffs and units
might become thoroughly acquainted with each other,
and that the individual battalions of each Brigade might
have a sufficient opportunity of creating the divisional
<i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> which experience has shown to be so
necessary in action.</p>

<p>But the three months of routine work will provide us
with a useful respite in which to make some reference to
one or two developments in organisation which were
carried out before the British forces plunged into the
dreary and protracted struggles of the Somme, and which
affected the 1/4th Londons equally with other units.</p>

<p>One of the developments which took place about this
period, and which had an effect on the general efficiency
of the Army so far-reaching that its value can hardly be
overestimated, was the formation of Army and Divisional
Schools, in which the lead was taken by the Third Army.
These schools, as is well known, were established under
selected bodies of instructors to achieve the double object
of keeping the fighting troops, through the medium of
the regimental officers and non-commissioned officers who
attended them for short courses of instruction, in touch
with the progress made from time to time in the art of
war, and particularly in the more technical branches,
such as gas, bombing, Lewis gunnery, etc., and also of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
assisting battalions to provide efficient courses of instruction
and training for their own personnel while out of the
trenches for short periods. The success which in general
attended these efforts was great and their influence on the
action of our troops in the great battles of the latter part
of the War was undoubtedly far-reaching.</p>

<p>The 56th Divisional Schools were first established under
Major D. V. Smith, D.S.O., 1/1st Londons, at Givenchy-le-Noble
and Ambrines in April 1916.</p>

<p>Attention was also directed at this time towards
training the infantry to assume greater responsibility for
the general maintenance and strengthening of the forward
trenches in their own occupation, and thereby releasing
the Royal Engineers for works requiring more technical
skill. To this end the early days of March saw the
formation in the Division of trench pioneer squads in
each battalion consisting of selected men under the supervision
of a subaltern officer. These squads were given
special training in erecting wire entanglements, constructing
strong points and consolidation of newly captured
positions. The first trench pioneer officer of the 1/4th
Londons was 2/Lieut. V. C. Donaldson, and under him
the trench pioneers began to shape well towards efficiency;
but the need for the existence of such squads was subsequently
modified to some extent by the attachment to
each Division of a specially trained Pioneer Battalion,
the 1/5th Cheshire Regiment joining the 56th Division
in this capacity. The Pioneer Battalions were fighting
units but, as their name implies, were employed more
particularly on constructional work rather beyond the
powers of the ordinary infantry officer to direct or of the
troops to execute, and in active operations their usefulness
in consolidating new trenches and similar duties was
established beyond a doubt. The advent of such highly
trained units had a tendency somewhat, perhaps not
altogether rightly, to depreciate the value of battalion
pioneer squads, and ultimately these were done away
with. The duty of trench working parties, whether in
active operations or in holding trenches, afterwards fell
equally on all the personnel of the companies, while in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the 56th Division if not in others, general direction was
given to the Battalion's activity in trench work by a
"Works" officer attached to Battalion Headquarters.
This appointment established early in June 1916 was first
filled in the 1/4th Londons by Capt. R. N. Arthur, and
remained in existence until the end of the War. The Works
officer became responsible for making arrangements between
company commanders and the Royal Engineers
for the supply of the material required for the trench work
undertaken by the companies in the line, for detailing
the working parties supplied by the Battalion while out
of the line, and in general forming a link between the
Commanding Officer and the company commanders in
the matter of trench work.</p>

<p>A further development occurred in the formation of
a Headquarters Company, called in the 1/4th Londons
for ease of distinction K Company. The object of this
change was to separate so far as was reasonably possible
the fighting personnel of the Battalion from the administrative
personnel, such as transport, headquarters clerks
and telephone operators; and to relieve the company
commander of responsibility as regards clothing, pay
and accommodation, etc., of such administrative personnel
by bringing them under the direct control of a Headquarters
officer, usually the Assistant-Adjutant, to whom
as a rule such men were more accessible than to the
company officers. This left the companies more intact
as fighting units and much reduced the work of company
quartermaster-sergeants in looking after large numbers
of men who in practice were seldom with the company.
Upon the whole the system worked exceedingly well;
though, as was almost inevitable, K Company showed
from time to time a tendency to assume unreasonable
proportions and required a little "weeding out."</p>

<p>At least a passing reference must be made to the 56th
Division's famous concert troop, the Bow Bells. The
uniform excellence of its entertainments from its inception
till the end of the war was the means of providing
all ranks of the Division from time to time with hours
of intense pleasure and mental rest of inestimable value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Lastly, mention must be made of an institution which
made its appearance in the Battalion about this time and
carried out exceedingly useful work, namely, the Regimental
Canteen. Thousands of 1/4th London men have
happy recollections of Sergt. Plumbley and his assistant
Pte. Blight, who, like the sutlers of former wars, followed
the Battalion in all its wanderings with their welcome
stocks of tobacco, chocolate, notepaper, newspapers and
other useful articles, and, fair times or foul, were always
to be found with their little shop neatly set out in a
dugout or a ruined cottage not very far in rear of the
most advanced troops of the Battalion.</p>

<p>The Battalion occupied its comfortable quarters at
Citerne for about a fortnight amid conditions which
presented a total change from those amidst which it had
passed the previous year, and which brought a corresponding
benefit to the troops by way of mental as well
as physical recuperation. The Hallencourt area, lying
as it does on the broad rolling hills of Ponthieu on the
west bank of the Somme, formed a complete contrast to
the dreary flats and marches of Flanders not only in the
pretty variation of the landscape but also because this
part of the country was unscarred by the ravages of war.
At Citerne, moreover, the Battalion for the first time since
it joined the Ferozepore Brigade in February 1915 was
stationed beyond the range of heavy gun fire. Citerne
is but a small village, but its kindly and warm-hearted
folk, from M. le Maire downwards, will always be held
in grateful remembrance by those of the 1/4th Londons
who had the good fortune to enjoy their hospitality.</p>

<p>The fortnight's sojourn here was devoted principally
to training, but the amusement of the Battalion was
not overlooked and football matches with other units
and concerts in the tiny village theatre made a welcome
break in the routine of parades.</p>

<p>At Citerne the 1/4th Londons became possessed for
the first time in France of a Chaplain, the Rev. R. Palmer,
C.F., Brigade Chaplain, being attached to the Battalion
on the 19th February. The Battalion was also rejoined
at Citerne by Capt. W. Moore, who had been hit at Ypres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the previous April, and was further strengthened by
the arrival of a draft of 95 N.C.O.'s and men.</p>

<p>On the 27th February the Division moved to a fresh
training area on the opposite bank of the Somme, Divisional
Headquarters opening at Domart, when the 168th Brigade
Headquarters and the Battalion were billeted in Vauchelles.
Here the programme of training was continued until the
12th March, on which day a second move was made, this
time to the Doullens area, all the battalions of the 168th
Brigade occupying billets in the town.</p>

<p>On the 8th March a further reinforcement of 100
N.C.O.'s and men arrived from the 4/4th Battalion and
was posted to companies. At this time also the bad
news was received that Lieut.-Col. L. T. Burnett, who
had gone on leave in January, was unfit to return overseas,
and Major W. G. Clark, D.S.O., therefore continued in
command of the Battalion, with Major W. Moore as second
in command.</p>

<p>Doullens did not provide a refuge to the Brigade for
long for the 15th March saw the Division once more on
the move to the Le Cauroy area (east of Frevent), the
1/4th Londons taking over billets at Beaufort. In this
area the Division settled down steadily to a period of
training which continued without interruption and with
very little incident calling for notice for nearly seven
weeks, during which the strength of the Battalion, as of
all other units, gradually crept up, if not to war strength
at least to such size that it became abundantly evident
that the Division was not destined to remain for long in
billets behind the line. Drafts joined the Battalion
consisting of 2/Lieuts. G. E. Stanbridge, G. H. Davis
and A. G. Blunn, and also of 87 other ranks on the 22nd
March; of 12 other ranks on the 6th April; and a final
reinforcement of 33 other ranks arrived on the 20th
April; these additions bringing the Battalion to the
respectable strength of nearly 600 all ranks.</p>

<p>During the same period the Battalion suffered losses
among officers in Capt. J. R. Pyper, M.C., who was
seconded to the 168th Brigade Machine-Gun Company;
Lieut. S. E. H. Walmisley, who after carrying out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
duties of Quartermaster for nearly four months during
the absence on sick leave of Lieut. E. S. Tomsett, was
appointed to the Central Training School, Rouen; and
2/Lieut. C. R. P. de Pury who was seconded as R.T.O.</p>

<p>On the 23rd March Major W. G. Clark, D.S.O., left the
Battalion on short leave and he also succumbed to a
severe breakdown while at home and was unable to return.
Command of the Battalion was carried on temporarily
by Major W. Moore until the 8th April, when Lieut.-Col.
L. L. Wheatley, D.S.O., Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders,
Staff Captain 168th Infantry Brigade, took
command.</p>

<p>It would be but tiresome to follow the daily routine
of the Battalion during this prolonged period of rest
where one day's work so much resembles that which
preceded it, and we may therefore be forgiven for passing
quickly over this part of the record. Enough has been
said to show how from the Battalion point of view the
Division came into being and was prepared for the work
allotted to it, and it remains therefore for us to pass on
and endeavour to recount the manner in which the 1/4th
Londons performed their task.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

THE 1/4TH BATTALION IN THE BATTLES OF THE
SOMME, 1916</h2>


<h3>I. <em>The Attack on Gommecourt</em></h3>

<p>The spring of 1916 was marked by two enemy offensives,
at Verdun and on the Italian front, both of which tried
the resources of our Allies severely. In order to draw off
German troops to the East the Russian offensive against
the Austrians had been started in May, but in spite of
this the German pressure against Verdun continued to
increase.</p>

<p>Sir Douglas Haig had for some time intended to
undertake an offensive operation on a large scale during
1916 in conjunction with the French, and in view of the
continual increase in the strength of the British Armies
it was clearly desirable that the launching of the battle
should be delayed as long as possible consistent with
the advance of the summer. But in view of the great
pressure at Verdun it was decided that the British attacks
should begin at the latest at the end of June, with the
objects of relieving our Allies and of pinning as many
enemies as possible to the front opposite the British
Armies, in addition to the tactical improvement of our
positions.</p>

<p>The part of the enemy's lines selected for attack was
the right of the British front, opposite which the Germans
occupied high ground forming the watershed between
the River Somme and the rivers flowing north-east into
Belgium. The general direction of this watershed, which
consists of a chalk country of broad swelling downs and
deep well-wooded valleys, is roughly from east-south-east
to west-north-west. The aspect of this country bears
a general resemblance to parts of Wiltshire, and the
gentle undulations of the higher slopes of the hills, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
descend with unexpected abruptness into waterless valleys
lined with banks whose declivitous sides seem to have
been shaped by human agency, cause the resemblance
to be one also of detail. From this watershed a series
of long spurs runs south-westerly towards the Somme,
and on their lower slopes the German lines ran from
Curlu near the river at first north and then almost due
west to Fricourt, a distance of some 10,000 yards. At
Fricourt the lines took an abrupt turn northward for
a further 10,000 yards when they crossed the Ancre,
a tributary of the Somme, near Hamel. From this
point they continued in a generally northerly direction,
passing through Beaumont Hamel, west of Serre and
between Hébuterne and Gommecourt. In the neighbourhood
of the two last-named villages the lines crossed
the summit of the main watershed, and thence descended
gently in a north-easterly direction towards Arras.</p>

<p>On the 20,000 yards between the Somme and the
Ancre the enemy had already prepared a strong second
system of defence about two miles in rear of the front
system; and on the whole front from Gommecourt to
the Somme he had spared no effort in the nearly two
years of his uninterrupted occupation to render these
positions impregnable. The strengthening of woods and
villages into fortresses, and the skilful use of the ground
in siting trenches and gun and machine-gun emplacements,
had in fact woven his successive lines of trenches into
one composite system. Yet further in rear he was still
at work improving existing defences and constructing new.</p>

<p>The front of attack on which the British armies were
to operate covered the whole of the above described line
from Gommecourt to Curlu&mdash;a total of about 17 miles&mdash;while
the French were to co-operate on a wide front
immediately south of the River Somme.</p>

<p>The story of the struggle which, lasting from the
beginning of July until the early part of November, gave
us possession, first of the forward trench systems, then
of the crest of the ridge, and finally of the whole plateau
and parts of the further slopes, divides itself into phases,
which can be dealt with in turn to such an extent as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
record of the 1/4th Battalion is concerned with them.
For the present we are concerned with the enormous
preparations which preceded the opening of the struggle
and of the first phase of the battle which began on the
1st July 1916.</p>

<p>Dealing with the preparations for the battle generally,
an enormous amount of work was required in improving
road and rail communications; in digging assembly
trenches and dugouts, for use not only as shelters but
also as aid posts and stores for ammunition for small
arms and trench mortars; and in constructing many
additional machine-gun and gun emplacements. The
water supply for the assaulting troops presented a serious
problem, and Sir Douglas Haig records in his Despatches
that in this connection over a hundred pumping plants
were installed and over 120 miles of water mains laid.</p>

<p>During most of the period in which this preliminary
labour proceeded the troops were working under most
trying weather conditions and frequently were harassed
by heavy enemy fire.</p>

<p>The particular tasks for which the 168th Brigade, and
in particular the 1/4th Londons, were called upon will
be referred to in their places at greater length.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After remaining in training in the Frevent area for
the latter half of March and the whole of April the 56th
Division moved forward on the 3rd and 4th of May into
the VII Corps area (D'Oyly Snow) and took over from
the 46th Division a sector of the line in front of the village
of Hébuterne and facing Gommecourt.</p>

<p>The line was occupied by the 167th Brigade, the
168th moving in reserve to Souastre, a small village some
three miles west of the front trenches. The Battalion
moved by march route from Beaufort on the 6th and
arrived at Souastre after a ten mile march at 9 p.m.</p>

<p>Two or three days were occupied in training, and on
the 11th May the Battalion began to supply working
parties of considerable size. Of these, one of 200 all
ranks was despatched to Pas and employed in felling
and sawing trees to form props for gun pits and dugouts;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and another of 250 all ranks went to the chalk quarries
of Hénu, where they were given a task in digging road
material. These working parties, the first of many weary
tasks, constituted so far as the Battalion was concerned
the first direct active preparations in the area of battle
for the Somme offensive.</p>

<p>The Battalion's duty at Souastre lasted a fortnight.
Work, however, did not take up the whole of the
Battalion's time, and opportunity was found for a football
match with the Kensingtons, which was played on the
12th May and resulted in a draw at one all. A few days
later the Battalion entered representatives at the London
Scottish sports at St. Amand, securing second and third
places in the "open" 200 yards.</p>

<p>On the 15th Major H. J. Duncan-Teape rejoined the
Battalion and was appointed second in command. The
works programme was now beginning to be operated by
Brigade Headquarters to the fullest extent and the greatest
possible working strength was daily employed, the chief
tasks being the digging of cable trenches for the signal
services, the construction of new dugouts and the deepening
and strengthening of existing communication and fire
trenches.</p>

<p>D Company and one platoon of B Company in fact
were despatched on the 18th to Hébuterne, where they
were billeted for night digging work; and every available
man of the remaining companies was detailed for work
of one sort or another. So insistent was the demand for
more labour that on the 20th May the band and every
available man of the transport section had to be put to
work on digging parties.</p>

<p>On the 20th and 21st May a series of Brigade reliefs
took place, the trenches being occupied by the 169th
Brigade, who replaced the 167th; while the 168th withdrew
in Divisional reserve to Grenas, a hamlet near the
Doullens-Arras Road, where Brigade Headquarters opened
on the 21st. The Rangers and Scottish were billeted
close by at Halloy; but the 1/4th Londons and the
Kensingtons remained in the forward area attached to
the 169th Brigade, the latter battalion occupying W sector,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
on the right of the Divisional front. The 1/4th Londons
moved on the 21st in Brigade reserve to Bayencourt,
about a mile and a half south of Souastre and slightly
nearer the trenches.</p>

<p>On the 22nd the detachments in Hébuterne were
relieved by C Company, who took over their tasks. Each
night of the period of duty in Bayencourt the Battalion
continued to supply large numbers of men for fatigues
of various sorts, the parties being small and divided
amongst a large number of tasks. These working parties
were equipped as lightly as possible, the men carrying
water-bottles and respirators over the left shoulder; a
bandolier of fifty rounds over the right shoulder; and
their rifles with bayonet in scabbard fixed. But although
the troops moved "light" the duties were onerous, partly
from the long hours of work and the strain induced by the
short available time in which to complete apparently
impossible tasks; and not least by the bad weather, the
season from the middle of May onwards being for the
most part wet. Hitherto practically no casualties had
been sustained, the first recorded casualties at the enemy's
hands during the Battalion's attachment to the 56th
Division occurring on the 24th May, when two men
were wounded at work in Hébuterne.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 28th May the 1/4th Londons
relieved the Kensingtons in W subsector of the Divisional
front, the Battalion still being under the orders of the
169th Brigade. The Kensingtons took over on relief the
billets at Bayencourt.</p>

<p>The Divisional sector as taken over from the 46th
Division early in May had consisted of the original line
taken up by the French troops in October 1914 during
the extension of the battle line from the Aisne to the sea.
This line the French had continued to hold until they
were finally relieved of responsibility for it in June 1915,
when the British extended their lines southward to the
Somme. The frontage of the sector extended as shown
on Map No. 4 from the Bucquoy Road on the right to a
point opposite the most westerly point of Gommecourt
Wood on the left, being divided into two subsectors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
W and Y, by an imaginary line running roughly parallel
to, and 200 yards north of, the Hébuterne-Bucquoy Road.
Opposite the British lines the Germans held a position
of enormous strength bastioned by the enclosure of
Gommecourt Wood which marked an abrupt salient in
their line. As was only too frequently the case the
enemy possessed considerable advantages of observation
over the British lines, the ground rising steadily in rear
of his front trenches to the Gommecourt-Bucquoy ridge,
which, although not a hill of outstanding pre-eminence,
formed the summit of the Somme watershed described
earlier in this chapter.</p>

<p>Except in the neighbourhood of villages such as
Hébuterne, which are surrounded by orchards and enclosed
in a ring fence, the Somme country is, like most
of Picardy and Artois, devoid of hedges, and from road
to road the swell of the hillside is unbroken by fence or
ditch. The roads themselves, however, are in many cases
"sunken," that is, contained in a deep cutting, the cover
afforded by the banks playing an important part in the
actions fought in this area.</p>

<p>A glance at the map will help to make the position
clear. The trench line shown as a reserve position on
the map and marked as the WR and YR lines was at
the date of the 56th Division's advent the most advanced
trench, so that No Man's Land varied in width from
800 to 600 yards. This fact is most important and a
full realisation of it is essential to a correct understanding
of the enormous task performed by the 56th Division.</p>

<p>In view of the impending attack the great width of
No Man's Land was clearly a great disadvantage, as the
time which must necessarily be occupied by assaulting
columns in advancing an average of distance of 700 yards
before reaching the German front line would expose them
to risk of very serious loss and possibly deprive the attack
completely of the weight necessary to enable it to be
driven home. Nothing daunted by this difficulty, however,
the 56th Division at once proceeded to make
arrangements to push the lines forward and roughly to
halve the width of No Man's Land. This audacious
scheme was put into operation, and before the end of May
the construction of the new front line&mdash;that shown as
the front line on the map&mdash;was begun.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>The operation of digging a new front line at no great
distance from the enemy was one of considerable difficulty.
It was clearly essential to perform the work at night,
and in view of the importance of the work it was equally
clearly a matter of necessity to have the task set out with
tapes as a mark for the troops to dig to. It was further
reasonable to anticipate that as soon as the enemy became
aware of the existence of the new line he would shell it
violently, and therefore the new trench must be sunk
deeply enough in the first night's work to enable its completion
to be carried on from inside without the need for
moving troops about in the open. This aim postulated
a working party of great strength, for the front to be
covered was nearly 2000 yards, and the noise which must
inevitably arise from over a mile of shovels and picks
hard at work was likely to bring down a hail of machine-gun
bullets and cause very severe casualties, and even,
in the presence of an enterprising enemy, the probability
of a surprise attack in the middle of the work. The
attempt was clearly fraught with great risk, but with
characteristic boldness Gen. Hull determined to make the
attempt.</p>

<p>On the night of the 25/26th May the setting out of
the work was safely accomplished by the Royal Engineers
under cover of a screen of scouts, and the following night
a working party of 3000 men got to work on the digging,
a line of outposts being established for their protection
within 200 yards of the German line.</p>

<p>The Battalion responsible for W&mdash;the right or southern&mdash;sector
of the new line was the 1/4th Londons, the work
being under the control of Major Duncan-Teape, while
the L.R.B. undertook the work in Y sector. The night
luckily passed quietly, and all ranks working with a will
the new trench, shown on map as W 47, W 48, W 49
and W 50, was opened and sunk to a depth sufficient to
provide cover.</p>

<p>When the Battalion, therefore, took over W sector on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the night of the 28th May, the new front line was becoming
fit to occupy and had, moreover, reached the anticipated
stage in which, the Bosche being alive to what had been
done, it was becoming a favourite target for his shells
and trench mortar bombs of all calibres. From this time
onwards, in fact until the battle, the Divisional sector and
in particular the new trenches were daily harassed by the
enemy's fire, and constant repair work on the part of our
trench garrisons was called for in addition to the continuance
of new construction.</p>

<p>The front line of W sector was taken up by A Company
(A. R. Moore) on the right with B Company (S. Elliott)
on the left, supports to both front line companies being
found by D Company (Giles), while C Company (Long)
was in reserve at Hébuterne. Battalion Headquarters
occupied dugouts beneath a roller flour mill in Hébuterne.
The move forward from Bayencourt for this relief being
made in daylight was carried out across country along
tracks, platoons moving separately at 300 yards distance.</p>

<p>After relief the Kensingtons in Bayencourt remained
at the disposal of the 1/4th Londons for working parties,
for the construction of the new front line was but
a small beginning of the task which still remained to be
completed before the opening of the battle. In addition
to the first line there was to be dug a control trench
immediately in rear of it, and a new support line&mdash;the
WS line&mdash;and all these were to be connected up by the
advancement from the old WR line of Warrior, Welcome,
Whisky, Woman and Wood Street communication trenches.
These defensive works completed, there was also the
erection of the necessary wire entanglements in front,
the construction of dugouts for shelters, company headquarters,
ammunition stores, and signal offices; the laying
of armoured signal cable from all headquarters dugouts
back to battalion and brigade, the digging of cable trenches
for lines of particular importance, the collection of
the necessary supplies of small arms and trench mortar
ammunition and bombs in dumps; and other tasks of
varying importance and interest. Enough has been said,
however, to indicate that with only a month in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
to do all this work it was clear that the Battalion was
not likely to find time hanging heavily on its hands while
in the line,&mdash;and indeed it did not.</p>

<p>The tour of duty proved somewhat unpleasant. The
works programme was, of course, the outstanding duty,
and all ranks put their shoulders to it with a will, but
the heavy rains which fell each day made it hard to keep
pace with the time-table set for the work, while the
remarkable aggressiveness of the enemy's guns added to
the digging scheme by providing much undesired practice
in trench repair work.</p>

<p>During the night following the relief the Battalion's
positions were heavily bombarded by heavy guns and
trench mortars, which caused much damage and several
casualties, especially in the left company front. Capt.
Elliott had to be dug out of the trench which was
blown in on him, and he was sent to hospital suffering
from severe concussion; and 3 N.C.O.'s and men were
killed and 12 wounded. Capt. Elliott was unhappily
never able to return to France, and in him the
Battalion lost an officer of remarkably cool and sound
judgment and of wide sympathy with the welfare of
his men.</p>

<p>The 30th May opened with a heavy bombardment of
our lines at 12.15 a.m., which was repeated half an hour
later. About 2.50 a.m., following further bombardment,
the S.O.S. signal was received from the Queen Victoria's
Rifles in Y subsector, who reported the enemy advancing.
A very quick response to the call was made by our
artillery, which laid down a barrage on S.O.S. lines; but
no infantry movement developed on our front. At
about 5 p.m. the enemy turned his attention to Battalion
Headquarters in Hébuterne, which were heavily shelled
and severely damaged. The sentry on duty was badly
wounded, as were also four other men of the Headquarters
staff and four of D Company billeted in an adjoining
dugout. The total casualties for the day amounted to
31, of whom 16 in B Company were cases of severe shell
shock following the previous day's bombardment.</p>

<p>This unpleasant degree of Bosche activity continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
during the night, when our working parties were harassed
and seriously delayed; and the 31st May saw no abatement
of the shelling. Battalion Headquarters again received
a "hate" at about 5 p.m., and the casualties for
the day were Lieut. H. B. A. Balls, wounded at duty,
and in N.C.O.'s and men, 1 killed and 3 wounded.</p>

<p>Throughout this tour of duty the promptness with
which the Divisional artillery responded to calls for
retaliatory fire against the enemy's activity was excellent
and did a great deal to inspire all ranks with confidence
in the gunners.</p>

<p>Further heavy bombardments occurred on the 1st June,
which caused a very great deal of damage to the new
trenches. On the afternoon of the next day the 1/4th
Londons were relieved by the London Scottish, withdrawing
on relief to Bayencourt, where tea was served
and valises picked up from the stores. In the evening
the Battalion was concentrated in huts at Souastre. The
Kensingtons had also been relieved by the Rangers, who
with the Scottish now came under the orders of the
169th Brigade.</p>

<p>A day was spent in Souastre by the Battalion in
cleaning trench mud from uniforms and equipment, and
in the evening it moved by march route <em>via</em> Hénu to
Halloy, where it came once more under the orders of the
168th Brigade in Divisional reserve.</p>

<p>During this period of preparations for the battle the
strength of the Battalion had been steadily creeping up
with reinforcements from home and from the disbanded
2/4th Battalion. The drafts from the 2/4th Battalion
were particularly valuable; they had all seen active
service and, moreover, they were rich in potential N.C.O.'s.
Throughout the hard fighting which followed the Battalion
was fortunate in having so great an internal reserve of
strength in this respect. As already recorded the 2/4th
Battalion had been on overseas service for nearly eighteen
months without the grant of any home leave. Through
the special intervention of Lieut.-Col. Wheatley several
large allotments of leave were made to the 1/4th Londons,
and these were used chiefly for the benefit of the 2/4th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Battalion reinforcements, but it was of course inevitable
that large numbers of men should be unable to obtain
leave before the 1st July.</p>

<p>The drafts received were:</p>

<div class="hangindent8">

<p>7th May&mdash;2/Lieuts. F. R. C. Bradford, C. S. G. Blows, J. W.
Price and S. Davis, and 214 other ranks from the
2/4th Battalion.</p>

<p>14th May&mdash;44 other ranks from the Reserve Battalion.</p>

<p>24th May&mdash;130 other ranks from the 2/4th Battalion.</p></div>

<p>When the last-noted draft joined, the Battalion was
treated to the annoying spectacle of watching a further
100 men of the 2/4th Battalion marching by <i lang="fr">en route</i> for
the Kensingtons.</p>

<p>The day following arrival at Halloy being Sunday,
a parade service was held, the first since the 14th May;
and later in the day a further reinforcement, this time
composed entirely of officers, reported to the Battalion
from the disbanded 2/4th Battalion, as follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Capts. R. N. Arthur and H. G. Stanham, Lieuts. W. R.
Botterill and W. A. Stark, and 2/Lieuts. H. W. Vernon,
B. F. L. Yeoman, H. G. Hicklenton and N. W. Williams.</p></div>

<p>The two first-named officers had been mobilised with
the 1/4th Battalion in August 1914, and were thus
particularly welcome. The officers of this draft were
distributed among the companies, and Capt. Arthur took
over the duties of Works Officer as Major, an appointment
he continued to fill until the 27th June, when he was
evacuated to hospital seriously ill.</p>

<p>The 5th, 6th and 7th June were spent in training, of
which the principal feature was a practice attack over
trenches constructed to represent those opposite the
sector of line which the Battalion had just left, in
preparation, of course, for the coming battle. Following
the last day's practice the Battalion was inspected by
the Third Army commander, Sir Edmund Allenby, who
was accompanied by Major-Gen. Hull and Brig.-Gen.
Loch, and expressed himself satisfied with all that he had
seen and also with what he had heard of the Battalion's
behaviour during its recent tour of duty. A report of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
this kind may read curiously at first in view of the fact
that the Battalion had been in France for eighteen months
and had proved its steadiness in the line on many occasions:
but remember that the 56th Division was brand new, and
commanders so far did not know how their troops would
shape in action. Praise from Allenby at this stage was
therefore praise indeed.</p>

<p>The same day the Battalion was once more sent adrift
from its own Brigade and became attached for duty to
the 169th Brigade, though it retained its billets at Halloy,
and the 168th Brigade took over W and Y sectors, Headquarters
moving from Grenas to Sailly.</p>

<p>The Battalion now became responsible for the various
works duties in the back area, relieving the L.R.B. in
this monotonous task; and from this date onwards remained
hard at work on various tasks until almost the
eve of battle. B Company was despatched to Mondicourt,
an important and vast R.E. dump on the Doullens-Arras
Road, for work under the R.E.'s. The remaining companies
were split up to supply parties for the daily work,
the total numbers found each day being 8 officers and
350 other ranks, employed on such varied tasks as digging
road material in Halloy quarries; carrying logs at Pas
for gun emplacements; shifting and loading timber at
Mondicourt; and working in the R.E. workshop at Pas.
This programme was pushed forward without a break
until the 12th June, the only intermission being an
inspection on Sunday the 11th, of such remnants of the
Battalion as were available, by Sir Charles Wakefield,
then Lord Mayor of London, who was accompanied by
Major-Gen. Hull and Col. Evelyn Wood, and addressed
the troops.</p>

<p>On the 13th a further redistribution of Brigades took
place, the 168th remaining in line but retaining W sector
only; Y sector was handed over to the 169th Brigade;
while the 167th moved back into reserve. This move
placed the Brigades in the positions they were destined
to occupy on the day of battle. The same day the 1/4th
Londons moved forward, leaving Halloy at 5 p.m., and
marching <em>via</em> Authie, St Leger and Coigneux to Bayen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>court,
where it was joined in billets by B Company from
detachment at Mondicourt. A Company was pushed
straight on to Hébuterne, when in spite of its long march
and late arrival in billets it set to work on its share of the
Brigade works programme at 5 a.m. on the 14th June.</p>

<p>The remaining companies were also set to work on the
14th in Hébuterne on parts of the Brigade scheme, working
hours being nightly from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. The parties
were much split up, 280 being detailed to the 2/2nd Field
Company R.E., 140 to the 5th Cheshires and 140 to the
Brigade Signal Officer for digging cable trenches. The
tasks were various, but were all directed in one way or
another to the completion and repair of the new trench
system and the necessary dugouts for the impending
offensive. Night after night, for fourteen nights in succession,
did the Battalion continue these stiff working parties.
Each night there was a march of nearly three miles in
each direction between billets and work, each night the
Bosche was unpleasantly active with machine-guns, and
nearly every night it rained steadily. That the Battalion
carried out this depressing duty&mdash;for there is nothing
with which the average infantryman gets more quickly
"fed up" than continual working parties&mdash;with such
efficiency and keenness is all the more to its credit. Conditions
were not comfortable and the men were beginning
to be tired; but they stuck to it well for they knew the
urgency of the work and how much remained to be done
in an impossibly short time.</p>

<p>On the 21st June the 167th Brigade took over the
whole Divisional sector for six days in order to give a
final rest to the 168th and 169th and to keep them as
fresh as possible for battle. The 168th withdrew to its
old rest billets at Halloy, but again the 1/4th Londons
were left behind as works battalion, remaining in Hébuterne
attached to the 167th Brigade and sticking to its works
programme.</p>

<p>On the 23rd June Lieut. W. J. Boutall rejoined the
Battalion from home and was posted to D Company, but
almost immediately took up the duties of Assistant
Adjutant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>A draft of the 2/4th Battalion arrived on the 24th,
consisting of Lieut. J. R. Webster and 40 other ranks.</p>

<p>Affairs in the line had now begun to "tune up."
Some days previously the British 9·2 batteries in Bayencourt
had begun to register, while on the 24th the
preliminary bombardment of the enemy's lines began
systematically, with occasional intense periods, alternating
with intervals of quiet. This continued daily&mdash;and
nightly&mdash;much to the discomfort of those who were lucky
enough to occupy billets with more or less sound ceilings,
for their nights were continually disturbed by large pieces
of plaster falling on them at each concussion! The
attack had been originally projected for the 29th June,
and in preparation for this the 168th and 169th Brigades
returned to the line in the afternoon of the 27th, the 1/4th
Londons advancing from Bayencourt, taking over the
whole of W sector from the 8th Middlesex.</p>

<p>The sector was occupied on a three-company frontage
as follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent8">

<p>D Company&mdash;(Giles) with two platoons in W 47 and 48, one platoon
in W 47 S and one in billets in Hébuterne.</p>

<p>A Company&mdash;(A. R. Moore) with two platoons in W 49, one in
W 49 S and one in billets in Hébuterne.</p>

<p>C Company&mdash;(Sykes) with two platoons in W 49 and 50, one in
W 50 S and one in Napier Trench.</p>

<p>B Company&mdash;(W. Moore) with two platoons in reserve dugouts in
Cross Street. The two remaining platoons of B
were detailed for special duties as Brigade
carrying parties respectively under the Bombing
and Machine-Gun Officers.</p></div>

<p>The Somme Battle was the first important offensive
in which steps were taken to reduce the number of officers
actually taking part to the smallest possible limits, and
a "battle surplus" of officers and also of warrant officers,
N.C.O.'s and men was therefore left behind in bivouacs
near Souastre when the Battalion moved into the line.
This precaution, which was always afterwards adopted,
was the means of avoiding unnecessary casualties and of
providing an immediate reinforcement, as might be required,
of fresh officers who would be acquainted with the
men. The officers left in "battle surplus" were Capts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
H. G. Stanham and A. L. Long, Lieuts. J. R. Webster
and H. W. Vernon, and 2/Lieuts. C. S. G. Blows and N. W.
Williams; and these were joined on the eve of battle by
Major H. J. Duncan-Teape and Lieut. W J. Boutall,
both of whom remained in the line until the last possible
minute. Lieut. W. R. Botterill also left the line before
the battle to proceed to Woolwich R.M. College.</p>

<p>During the day of relief the British bombardment of
the German lines was still proceeding, occasional intensive
bursts being used. At about 7.45 p.m. on the cessation
of a burst the enemy put down a very heavy retaliatory
barrage on the W and WR lines, causing a good deal of
damage, especially to the latter. In the course of this
shelling D Company's headquarters were blown in and
Capt. Giles was seriously wounded, one of his company
staff killed and another wounded. Poor Giles, who had
done magnificent work as platoon commander, adjutant
and company commander, and had never missed a day's
duty since August 1914, died in hospital from his injuries
a few days later. He was a gallant and unselfish officer.
His place in command of D Company was taken by
Stanham, who came forward from surplus.</p>

<p>During the evening two patrols were despatched from
New Woman Street to examine and report on the condition
of the enemy's wire and front line trenches. They
returned at 12.30 a.m. on the 28th, bringing samples of
German wire, which was reported as too thick to admit
of access to the front line. About the same time a rocket
signal was sent up from the Bosche line, a red light followed
by two more in quick succession, and this was the prelude to
a sharp bombardment of our lines for about fifteen minutes.
Somewhat later, about 3.45 a.m., a second barrage came
down, this time on Hébuterne, but the damage caused
was not great. As the day wore on the enemy's activity
became less intense though he exhibited great persistence
all day in his efforts to locate our batteries near Cross
Street and our trench mortar emplacements in W 47. At
night working parties were set on to the almost final
preparation of cutting gaps in our own wire at intervals
of about 50 to 70 yards to allow egress to the assaulting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
columns. This work is naturally rather tricky, and the
gaps, the cutting of which was left till the last minute,
must be so concealed if possible as to avoid the risk of
the enemy marking them down and plastering them with
shell fire.</p>

<p>The day's casualties amounted to 2 officers, Lieut.
W. A. Stark and J. W. Price wounded, and 2 men killed
and 11 wounded.</p>

<p>During the evening patrols had again been despatched
to investigate the enemy's wire and trenches, and this
night greater success was achieved. The right patrol
which approached the Bosche line in front of Farm-Farmyard
was under 2/Lieut. W. H. Webster, who on
looking over the enemy's parapet found he had selected
a firebay containing a party of Bosche hard at work.
Unfortunately the alarm was given and the presence of
the patrol being disclosed by Véry lights it was forced
to withdraw.</p>

<p>Late on the evening of the 29th the warning was
received that the attack was postponed for forty-eight
hours, until the 1st July.</p>

<p>Throughout the 29th our preliminary bombardment
continued with gradually increasing intensity; but it
was noticeable that in spite of the damage it was clearly
doing to the enemy's defences it was not by any means
successful in silencing his batteries. The German artillery
was in fact unpleasantly lively, and from 6.30 a.m. until
about 4.30 p.m. W sector was subjected to intermittent
harassing fire from field and machine-guns. This more
or less desultory fire was followed at 6 p.m. by a sharp
enemy barrage. All the evening the enemy's activity
continued, and the remarkable number of Véry lights
which he put up indicated his growing nervousness.
There was indeed now every reason to believe that the
Bosche expected our attack. The long-continued British
bombardment of trenches, dumps, cross roads and battery
positions, the systematic wire-cutting, and the activity
of our air forces, could have left no room for doubt in the
enemy's mind that an important offensive was being
launched. In some parts of the battle front, indeed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Germans had displayed notice boards inviting the British
to start their attack; and though probably these emanated
from individual bravado they formed some indication that
surprise effect was not to be expected, and that there was
good reason to believe that the Germans would with their
usual thoroughness have made preparations to offer the
most stubborn possible resistance to our projected advance.</p>

<p>The 29th also demanded its toll of casualties from the
Battalion, and this day 28 N.C.O.'s and men were wounded.</p>

<p>The 30th June opened with a heavy barrage on W
sector and Hébuterne at about midnight, but this subsided
after a few minutes and little further activity was
displayed by the enemy during the early morning hours.
As dawn approached the enemy's nervousness evidently
increased, and he maintained an almost continuous discharge
of Véry lights. From 7 a.m. onwards, however,
the enemy artillery once more began to show signs of
liveliness which increased as the day passed. The WR
line in the vicinity of Woman and Cross Streets was in
particular heavily shelled, and altogether a great amount
of damage was done to our trench system. This action
of the enemy did not call for any particular retaliatory
measures from our artillery, which proceeded with the
preliminary bombardment according to its programme.
The losses sustained by the Battalion on this day amounted
to 2 N.C.O.'s and men killed and 21 wounded, making a
total of 69 casualties during the three days the Battalion
had held the line.</p>

<p>Little has been said of the actual occupation of the
Battalion during these three days; there is so much to
relate of the battle day itself that space does not permit
us to dwell overmuch on the preceding period. But be
it understood that all the time the works programme
was being pushed on with feverish haste, though progress
was slow owing to the continued rain and the great
delay caused in the projected new work by having
to divert from it a large proportion of the available
strength to repair the damage caused by the daily
German bombardments.</p>

<p>During the evening the Battalion formed up in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
prearranged assembly areas in readiness for the attack
on the following morning.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The part which the 56th Division was called on to
play in the offensive was that of a combined operation
on a comparatively small front in conjunction with the
46th Division, which was in line opposite the northern
flank of the Gommecourt Salient and adjoining the 56th.
These Divisions which, with the 37th (not engaged),
formed the VII Corps and were the right flank of Allenby's
Third Army, were the two most northern divisions
operating in the Somme offensive.</p>

<p>Adjoining the 56th on the right lay Hunter-Weston's
VIII Corps, comprising from left to right the 31st, 4th
and 29th Divisions in line, with the 48th in support.
One Brigade of this last-named Division&mdash;the 143rd&mdash;was
in line between the 56th and the 31st, and its sector
formed a gap on which no forward move was attempted.
The Gommecourt operation was therefore entirely isolated,
though forming an inherent part of the one great offensive
plan.</p>

<p>South of the VIII Corps the British battle front was
taken up by the X Corps (Morland), III Corps (Pulteney),
XV Corps (Horne) and XIII Corps (Congreve), these
forming with the VIII, Rawlinson's Fourth Army.</p>

<p>The 56th Division's objectives, which will be easily
followed from the map, were to capture and consolidate
a line running almost due north from a strong point at
the south end of Farm-Farmyard, through Fame, Felon,
Fell, Fellow, and the Quadrilateral to the junction of
Fillet and Indus. From this point the line was to be
continued to the "little Z" (a point about 2000 yards
north of the apex of the Gommecourt Salient) by the
46th Division, who were to clear Gommecourt village and
park.</p>

<p>The 168th Brigade on the right of the Divisional sector
attacked on a two-battalion front from the strong point
on the right to the junction of Felon and Epte on the left.
Strong points were to be consolidated on the extreme right
and also at the junctions of Felon with Elbe and Epte.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
From this point the 169th Brigade was to continue the
line to the junction of Fir and Firm and also to the point
of union with the 46th Division.</p>

<p>The 167th Brigade was in Divisional reserve, and
one battalion, the 1st Londons, was detailed to supply
600 men to dig communication trenches across No Man's
Land after the attack.</p>

<p>The 168th Brigade group was disposed as follows:</p>


<dl>
  <dt class="center"><span class="smcap">Headquarters in Mardi Trench</span></dt>

  <dt><span class="smcap">Assaulting Battalions</span>&mdash;</dt>
    <dd>Right&mdash;London Scottish.</dd>
    <dd>Left&mdash;Rangers.</dd>

  <dt><span class="smcap">Supporting Battalions</span>&mdash;</dt>
    <dd>Right&mdash;Kensingtons, with a special task of digging a
        fire trench to form a defensive flank across
        No Man's Land from the head of Welcome
        Street.</dd>
    <dd>Left&mdash;1/4th Londons.</dd>
    <dd>168th M.G. Company&mdash;In tunnelled emplacements in the
        WR line for overhead covering fire.</dd>
    <dd>3-inch L.T.M. Battery (Stokes), (with half the 167th
        Brigade Battery)&mdash;In emplacements in the
        front line control trench.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In addition the following troops were at the disposal
of the Brigadier for the operation:</p>

<div class="center">
<ul>
  <li>One Company 5th Cheshires (Pioneers).</li>
  <li>One Section 2/2nd London Field Company, R.E.</li>
  <li>Y 56&mdash;2-inch Mortar Battery.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The artillery affiliated to the Brigade consisted of four
18-pr. batteries and one 4·5-inch howitzer battery, comprising
the southern group.</p>

<p>Similar attachments were made to the 167th Brigade,
and over and above these there remained at the disposal
of the Divisional artillery, a counter-battery group consisting
of two 18-pr. and one 4·5-inch howitzer batteries;
and two 18-pr. batteries in reserve; while of trench
mortars there were one 2-inch battery (X 56) and two
heavy (9½-inch) mortars.</p>

<p>During the evening of the 30th June the other battalions
of the Brigade began to move into W sector to take up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
their assembly positions. The assembly areas are marked
on the map in Roman numerals as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<ol class="RU">
  <li>London Scottish (right front).</li>
  <li>Rangers (left front).</li>
  <li>Kensingtons (right support).</li>
  <li>1/4th Londons (left support).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>As each battalion arrived and took over its area the
various companies of the 1/4th Londons withdrew to
No. IV area in rear of the Rangers. In order to avoid
congestion and cross traffic in the communication trenches
several platoons of the 1/4th Londons had to withdraw
to assembly position over the open, and by 10 p.m. this
operation was completed.</p>

<p>The 1st July was a glorious summer day, and the light
haze which tells of great heat hung over the rolling hills
of this great plain which was destined to become the
scene of so great a struggle. With the earliest grey of
dawn the Germans opened an intense bombardment on all
our trenches, to which no reply was made by our artillery.
This severe shelling started at about 2.45 a.m. and lasted
for nearly an hour: in the course of it part of the Rangers
were blown out of their assembly trenches and compelled
to make a temporary withdrawal to our area, causing a
good deal of congestion and confusion.</p>

<p>At 6.25 a.m. our week old bombardment increased to
"hurricane" intensity and every gun, trench mortar and
machine-gun on the British front from Gommecourt to
the Somme came into action, pouring a hail of shot and
shell into the enemy lines with merciless precision and
rapidity. Under such a colossal weight of metal it seemed
that nothing could live, and it was confidently hoped that
the bombardment would go far towards breaking down
the enemy's morale and power of resistance to our attack.</p>

<p>At 7.25 a.m. a smoke barrage was raised along the whole
front of the attack by firing smoke bombs from the front
trenches, and under this at 7.30 a.m. the British battalions
moved to the assault under cover of a creeping barrage,
a moving curtain of fire.</p>

<p>On the 168th Brigade front the attack was made by
each assaulting battalion on a four-company front, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
company in column of platoons in extended order. The
attack as a whole, therefore, moved in four "waves," and
following as a fifth wave moved a trench-clearing party consisting
of two platoons of B Company of the 1/4th Londons.</p>

<p>These platoons under 2/Lieuts. L. R. Chapman and
H. G. Hicklenton had the duty of completing the capture
of each trench line by killing the remaining garrison,
clearing the dugouts, and collecting and sending back the
prisoners; thereby saving delay to the assaulting waves,
who would otherwise have had to perform these duties
themselves to avoid the risk of an attack from the rear
after they had passed the first objective. These platoons
were made up to a strength of 1 officer, 3 N.C.O.'s and
36 men organised in four sections (clearing, bombing,
blocking and communicating), but during the hours of
waiting after assembly had already lost 26 men hit.</p>

<p>At the same time as the assaulting waves moved forward
the Battalion, less the two platoons of B Company
above, advanced and occupied battle positions in the area
vacated by the Rangers, as follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent8">

<p>A Company&mdash;(A. R. Moore) two platoons in front line trench and
two platoons in Boyau de Service, Sector W 49,
between Whisky Street and Woman Street.</p>

<p>C Company&mdash;(J. T. Sykes) two platoons in W 50 and two platoons
in the Boyau de Service, north and south of
Bucquoy Road.</p>

<p>D Company&mdash;(H. G. Stanham) formed up in line in trench W 49 S
and W 50 S.</p></div>

<p>The WS line occupied by D Company had been very
severely damaged by the German bombardment and
communication was therefore extremely difficult. The
company was inevitably much split up under the two
platoon commanders, G. H. Davis and B. F. L. Yeoman,
while Stanham took up a central position where he hoped
to keep in touch with both flanks.</p>

<p>The two remaining platoons of B Company were employed
as follows:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>1 Platoon&mdash;Carrying party under Brigade Bombing Officer.</dt>
  <dt>1 Platoon&mdash;1 Section&mdash;Carrying party to 168th M.G. Company.</dt>
    <dd>3 Sections&mdash;In reserve in Napier Trench.</dd>
</dl>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>A runner from the right company (A) reporting it in
position arrived at Headquarters at 8.15 a.m., but no
report was received from any other company, and from
this time onwards throughout the day communication was
exceedingly difficult on account of the very heavy German
barrage which fell on all lines in W sector immediately
after zero. It was reported, however, by observers that
all had successfully formed up on their battle positions.</p>

<p>We must now turn for a moment to the leading
battalions.</p>

<p>On the right the London Scottish advanced under the
effective cover of the smoke barrage, which was in fact
so thick as to render the maintenance of the correct direction
a matter of difficulty, and occupied Farm, Fell and
Fate as far north as the Bucquoy Road, and also the greater
part of the strong point at the southern extremity of
attack. The blocking of the adjoining trenches and consolidation
of the captured lines was at once put in hand.
The left companies appear to have been drawn off somewhat
towards Nameless Farm but seem to have kept in
touch with the Rangers on their left.</p>

<p>Shortly after 8 o'clock the Scottish were joined by a
company of Kensingtons, who did good work in the consolidation
of Farm-Farmyard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>On the left four companies of the Rangers also crossed
No Man's Land, and although the position is obscure there
can be no doubt that parties of all companies succeeded
in reaching the final objectives in Felon, Elbe and Epte,
and gained touch on Nameless Farm Road with the 169th
Brigade on the left.</p>

<p>At these advanced points bomb fighting in the communication
trenches began and the struggle was pursued
along the line with varying success. Realising the pressure
that was being brought to bear on his now dangerously
weak companies the O.C. Rangers asked for two companies
of the 1/4th Londons to lend the weight necessary
to carry forward his attack again.</p>

<p>This order was received by Lieut.-Col. Wheatley at
8.45 a.m. and at once he ordered A and C Companies to
reinforce the Rangers in Fetter, and D Company to move
up to the W front line in their place. Telephone communication
having been cut by the enemy shell fire this
order was despatched by runner to the front companies;
but of six runners despatched by different routes, and
two additional runners sent after fifteen minutes' interval,
only one returned after an unsuccessful attempt to find the
left company. The others were all killed. We must pause
here to offer a tribute to the bravery of runners, a class of
soldier whose gallantry was only too seldom adequately
rewarded; their duties compelled them to attempt to pass
through impossible barrages without the moral support of
comradeship, and to face almost certain death in the
forlorn hope of getting through with a vital order. But
never once did they flinch from their duty.</p>

<p>At 9.5 a.m. a report was received through the Rangers
that Rangers and 1/4th Londons were together in the
German front line, and this was followed at intervals by
other reports indicating their further progress, till at
10.25 a.m. a message from the Rangers reported parties
of both battalions in the second German trench. Following
the receipt of this information at 10.45 a.m. Lieut-Col.
Wheatley despatched the Battalion Trench Pioneers to
help consolidate the trenches gained.</p>

<p>The above messages probably convey a substantially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
correct idea of what occurred, but owing to the failure of
all means of communication on account of the intensity
of the German shell fire, the movements of A and C
Companies will probably never be known in detail. At
11.50 a.m. an untimed message was received from Capt.
A. R. Moore (A Company) reporting that he was still in
W 49, his battle position, though at 9.5 a.m., as we have
seen, he was reported to have crossed to the German line;
and probably this latter report is correct. The situation,
however, evidently required clearing up, and a patrol consisting
of L.-Corpl. Hyde and Pte. Lear despatched from
Battalion Headquarters succeeded in returning with the
information that A Company had gone forward. L.-Corpl.
Hyde was awarded the Military Medal for his good
work, and subsequently recommended for a commission
by Lieut.-Col. Wheatley; he was unfortunately killed in
action later in the Somme Battle whilst completing his
training with C Company.</p>

<p>At 1 p.m. a message was received from Stanham (in
reserve) that his Company had suffered about fifty per cent.
casualties and that his position had become untenable.
He was ordered to maintain his position.</p>

<p>By this time the situation on the other side of No Man's
Land was becoming desperate. The work of consolidation
was almost impossible owing to the German barrage, and
the sustained bomb fighting was rapidly becoming an
unequal struggle owing to the impossibility of replenishing
the dwindling supplies of bombs. Again and again with
unsurpassed devotion the carrying party endeavoured to
pass through the barrier of German shells with the coveted
supplies of bombs to our harassed troops&mdash;but passage was
impossible and the gallant carriers only added to the roll
of casualties.</p>

<p>At 1.30 p.m. a patrol returned from the German lines
to Battalion Headquarters. This had been despatched at
11 o'clock on a demand from the Brigadier for information
as to the left of the Brigade in the German line, and Ptes.
Whitehead and Buckingham had volunteered for the duty.
According to this patrol a party of the Rangers under
Lieut. Harper were holding on to the junction of Et and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Felt, but was urgently in need of bombs. Further, none
of the 168th Brigade were then in the German third line.
This report was passed on to Brigade and to the Rangers,
and a special bomb carrying party from the Battalion was
ordered across to relieve Harper's need. But none reached
the German line, all being killed or wounded in No Man's
Land. For their bravery and devotion to duty Ptes.
Whitehead and Buckingham were rewarded with the
Military Medal, and the former was subsequently granted
a commission.</p>

<p>At 2.30 p.m. the front of the Battalion Headquarters
dugout was blown in by a shell, which killed seven
and wounded seven men. At the time the dugout was
occupied by a large number of Headquarters staff, including
the Colonel, the Adjutant, the Signalling Officer and
Major Moore, but of these luckily none was hit.</p>

<p>All this time the German shell fire continued without
abatement, and at 3.30 p.m. further heavy casualties were
reported by D Company. At 3.45 p.m. Brigade Headquarters
ordered D Company to withdraw to the WR line,
and a report was received from Stanham at 4.45 p.m. that
his withdrawal with 1 officer and 20 men was complete.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Brigade was gradually being compelled
to give ground and, owing to its lack of bombs, to loose
its slender hold on the enemy's positions. At about 2 p.m.
the remnants of the Rangers, together with a few 1/4th
Londons and some Queen Victorias from the 169th
Brigade on the left, were driven into Fate, where they made
a last determined stand; but at 3.10 p.m. they were finally
ejected from the German lines and withdrew to the British
trenches.</p>

<p>On the right the Scottish and Kensingtons met with a
similar fate. A gallant fight was put up by the remains
of the Battalion under Capt. H. C. Sparks in Farm-Farmyard,
but by 4 p.m., both his flanks being in the air and
his whole force being in imminent danger of extinction,
Sparks decided to withdraw, this operation being stubbornly
and successfully carried out after the removal of
as many wounded as possible.</p>

<p>At 6.30 p.m. the 1/4th Londons reformed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
WR line between Wood Street and Woman Street, and
later in the evening moved into the trenches west of
Hébuterne.</p>

<p>The other battalions of the 168th were also withdrawn
and the sector was taken over by the 167th Brigade.</p>

<p>The story of the 169th Brigade attack is, like that of
the 168th, one of initial success which could not be maintained.
The line Fell-Feud was carried in the early hours
of the morning by the Queen Victorias and London Rifle
Brigade, but the intensity of the German shell fire and
the enfilading of the captured positions by machine-guns
in Gommecourt Park prevented the Queen's Westminsters
from carrying the Quadrilateral. Later in the day lack
of bombs, as in the case of the 168th Brigade, proved the
deciding factor, and resulted in a gradual loss of the
Brigade's grip on the enemy trenches, and after desperate
struggles the late afternoon hours found them also beaten
back to their original lines.</p>

<p>So ended the first day on which the 56th Division had
been in battle, a day on which after the most stubborn
fighting and unsurpassed devotion the gain of ground was
nil, and which dealt London the severest blow in loss of
personnel that it ever suffered on any single day throughout
the War.</p>

<p>The losses in the Division during the period 24th June
to 3rd July amounted to 4749 all ranks, of whom 35 officers
and 412 other ranks were killed, 107 officers and 2632
other ranks wounded, and 40 officers and 1532 other ranks
missing. In the 1/4th Londons the losses for the same
period totalled the appalling number of 16 officers and
534 other ranks. These dreadful losses were borne fairly
equally by all companies, for all had been exposed to the
same deadly and unrelenting shell fire throughout the day.</p>

<p>Of A Company, gallantly led to the second German
line by Capt. A. R. Moore, M.C., but 18 returned. Moore
himself and one of his subalterns, F. C. Fanhangel, were
killed, the other subaltern, A. G. Blunn, being captured
with 7 others. The rest of the company were killed.
Moore's end, like his life, was one of courageous devotion,
and has been simply told by one of his own sergeants:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
"Capt. Moore was wounded in the wrist about thirty
minutes before we went over. Nevertheless he led the
company, revolver in hand, and on the sunken road at
the rear of Nameless Farm I saw blood flowing from his
back. He still pushed on, and then I was shot through
the leg and took shelter in a shell hole. The last I saw
of Capt. Moore he was still going ahead...."</p>

<p>The two platoons of B Company which went forward
as clearing party were severely handled. Both the
subalterns, Chapman and Hicklenton, were hit and only
10 men got back from the German line. 2/Lieut. A. S.
Ford on carrying party duty was also hit.</p>

<p>Of C Company only two platoons got forward as the
order to advance failed to reach Sykes, the company
commander. But its casualties under the terrific German
barrage were as heavy as in any company, and after Sykes
had been wounded and both his subalterns, T. Moody and
F. R. C. Bradford, killed, the remnants of the company
were brought steadily out of action by Company Sergt.-Major
Davis, who was rewarded with the D.C.M.</p>

<p>D Company, which remained in reserve all day, had
perhaps the most trying time of all. From 2.30 a.m.
until withdrawn at 3.30 p.m. it sat still under the most
intense artillery bombardment, but was kept splendidly
in hand and ready to move by Stanham and his only
remaining subaltern, G. H. Davis. B. F. L. Yeoman
became a casualty early in the day.</p>

<p>Of the Headquarters officers Major W. Moore and
2/Lieut. V. C. Donaldson were wounded.</p>

<p>Magnificent work was done throughout the day by the
Medical Officer, Capt. Hurd, and his staff, who, though
the number of casualties far out-measured the facilities for
dealing with them, continued their work without a break
throughout the day and the night following. In this work
splendid help was rendered by the Padre, Rev. R. Palmer,
who organised and led search and carrying parties in
No Man's Land and brought in many wounded who were
unable to move.</p>

<p>The morning of the 2nd July was spent in the dreary
duty of ascertaining the casualties and reorganising the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
companies, and in the afternoon the Battalion marched
to billets at St Amand.</p>

<p>With the results of the day's fighting on other parts of the
front we are hardly concerned here. From Fricourt to the
Somme the day was successful and the bulk of the objectives
were captured and held. But from Fricourt northward
the tale throughout was one of complete check. Everywhere
our troops met with initial success which everywhere
was later changed into disaster with appalling losses.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that in the northern half of attack
the British offensive was fully anticipated by the Germans.
It would indeed have been difficult to carry out such
immense preparations over a period of several weeks prior
to the battle without permitting indications of the impending
attempt to become visible to hostile aerial scouts.
But it had been hoped that the weight and long continuance
of the preliminary bombardment, even though it disclosed
its own purpose, would prove so intense as to nullify all
the German efforts to resist.</p>

<p>We must here make some reference to the battle of the
46th Division on the northern face of the Gommecourt
salient. Against this ill-fated Division the German fire
was terrific. On the right the South Staffords were completely
shattered by the enemy's machine-guns before
they could cross No Man's Land; on the left the Sherwood
Foresters succeeded in gaining the German front line, and
isolated parties appear even to have struggled forward as
far as the second trench, but were rapidly ejected. Soon
after zero the whole of the 46th Division's assaulting
troops were back in their own line after suffering appalling
losses: their attack was a complete failure. At the time,
therefore, that the 56th Division was making headway
into the German positions, instead of the enemy feeling, as
had been hoped, the pincers closing on him from both
sides of his salient, he was relieved from all menace on his
right flank facing the 46th Division, and free to throw the
whole weight of his artillery and infantry against the 56th
Division.</p>

<p>But the causes of the 56th Division's failure must be
looked for deeper than this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>Primarily it may be said to have been due to the
shortage of bombs. The great distance which carrying
parties had to traverse over No Man's Land with fresh
supplies and the intensity of the German barrage through
which they had to pass were both such that the facilities
for getting bombs forward were inadequate. It should be
remembered that the 168th and 169th Brigades captured
three lines of German trenches and held them against all
attacks in spite of the gruelling enemy fire for many hours.
It was only when bomb supplies failed that they were
ejected.</p>

<p>There are three other factors in this battle to which we
may refer as having contributed to the failure.</p>

<p>First, the enormously strong deep dugouts in the
German lines, which were large enough to give shelter to
the whole trench garrison except the few necessary sentries,
had proved too strong for all except the heaviest guns;
and those of the heaviest calibre had not been directed
against them. The German garrisons were therefore able
to remain in safety until the last moment when our barrage
lifted off their front lines and they were able to man their
parapets. The strength of the German defences was
increased by the density and depth of their wire entanglements,
which had been most skilfully sited with the support
of machine-guns firing in enfilade.</p>

<p>Secondly, the insufficient attention paid on our side to
counter-battery work. The batteries told off for counter-battery
fire were too few and of too light calibre. Throughout
the day the cry arose from all Headquarters to silence
the German guns, but the few batteries available, though
served magnificently by splendid gunners, could not cope
with so gigantic a task.</p>

<p>The third and most important cause lay in the cunning
skill with which the German barrage was used. We have
referred above to the manning of the German parapets by
their garrisons after our barrage had passed over; but not
in every case did this happen. In many instances a
greater refinement of skill was exhibited. As the British
barrage lifted off the first objective and the leading waves
of the assault poured over it, down came the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
barrage like a dense curtain, cutting them off for ever
from their supports and their supplies. The barrage
having thus trapped them, the front trench filled with
Germans swarming up from their subterranean shelters,
and these poured a hail of machine-gun fire into the backs
of our waves which were pushing forward to the next line.</p>

<p>After the experience of two more years of organised
trench to trench attacks, it may be that failure for the
reasons detailed above seems a little obvious; but it
would not be fair to pass them over without pointing out
that this was the first trench to trench attack of the whole
War which had been organised on so vast a scale, and it
was clearly impossible to provide against all eventualities
when there was no previous experience to act as a guide.
It should be remembered that in the south, where a greater
degree of surprise was attained, the arrangements for attack&mdash;which
were substantially the same as in the north&mdash;worked
splendidly and resulted in marked success. And
in subsequent attacks attention was paid to the experience
gained on this great opening day of the First Somme Battle
in increasing the strength of counter-battery artillery and
in making more efficient arrangements for "mopping-up"
captured lines.</p>

<p>As regards the 168th Brigade attack, in addition to the
above general criticisms, it may be remarked that the
event showed that on the left of the Brigade at least there
was insufficient weight in the attack. The Scottish on the
right had to advance 250 yards and were able to carry
their objectives; but on the left the depth to be penetrated
was about 450 yards, and this proved too great for the
available strength of the Rangers, who were organised in
five waves, even when strengthened by two additional
waves supplied by the companies of the 1/4th Londons.</p>

<p>A deal of congestion in the trenches and a great many
casualties were caused by the lack of those deep dugouts
with which the Germans were so well supplied, and in the
case of the 1/4th Londons at any rate it seems likely that
they might have been of more use when called upon had
they been able to obtain efficient shelter during the hours
of waiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>We have sufficiently elaborated the causes of failure.
It must not be forgotten that a very real and important
result was achieved by the Londoners this day. The
strategic object of their attack was not primarily the
capture of ground but the holding of German troops and
guns from the area of our main attack. This was an
unpleasant rôle, but a highly important one, and there
can be no manner of doubt that it was to a very large
degree fulfilled. The Division's achievement is summarised
concisely in the message of congratulation issued by Lieut.-Gen.
D'Oyly Snow on the 4th July:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Corps Commander wishes to congratulate all ranks
of the 56th Division on the way in which they took the
German trenches and held them by pure grit and pluck
for so long in very adverse circumstances. Although
Gommecourt has not fallen into our hands, the purpose of
the attack, which was mainly to contain and kill Germans,
was accomplished, thanks to a great extent to the tenacity
of the 56th Division.</p></div>

<p>A remarkable incident occurred on the Divisional front
on the 2nd July. At about 2.30 p.m. that day a number
of German stretcher-bearers were seen to issue from their
trenches and begin collecting the many British wounded
who were still lying round about their first three lines of
trenches. Prompt measures of precaution were taken by
the Division, and all guns were made ready to open fire
on barrage lines should any intention be shown by the
Germans to take advantage of the temporary truce. As,
however, the enemy stretcher-bearers continued their
humane work quietly, our own stretcher-bearers followed
their example and began collecting casualties from No
Man's Land. During this extraordinary armistice no
attempt was made by the Germans to come outside or by
our men to go beyond the line which had formerly been
the German wire entanglements. After about two hours
of this work, which was the means of saving many lives,
the stretcher-bearers returned by mutual and tacit consent
to their own lines and the War was resumed!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The casualties suffered by the 46th Division were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
exceedingly heavy, and the treatment it had received
was so severe that it was deemed necessary to withdraw
it from the line temporarily, and arrangements were made
for the 56th Division to assume responsibility at once for
the 46th sector as well as its own.</p>

<p>This arrangement unfortunately deprived the 168th
Brigade of its well-earned rest. But though tired and in
need of reorganisation after the heavy losses it had
sustained the Brigade's morale was good, for it felt
justifiably proud of its effort of the previous day. The
relief of the 46th Division began on the evening of the
2nd July when the Scottish and the Kensingtons took
over the line from the left of the 56th sector of the
Fonquevillers-Gommecourt Road.</p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons remained at St Amand during the
3rd July, busily engaged in reorganising its platoons and
making up as far as possible deficiencies in equipment
and ammunition. In the evening the 1/4th Londons and
Rangers took over from the 138th Brigade the remainder
of the 46th Divisional sector, the Battalion relieving the
5th Lincolns on a front adjoining that occupied by the
Kensingtons the previous night.</p>

<p>The condition of the trenches was found to be shocking
and the material damage caused by shell and trench
mortar fire was severe, but the number of dead whose
bodies had not yet been removed, and of wounded who
still were lying out in No Man's Land provided a great
deal of work of the utmost urgency. Fortunately the
enemy did not interfere with this work of clearing up the
battlefield, and his lack of activity was doubtless due to
his being similarly employed. Reports were received at
night that enemy patrols were active in No Man's Land,
but no encounters took place and the Germans seen were
probably covering patrols for stretcher-bearing parties.</p>

<p>The following day passed without unusual incident
except for a certain amount of enemy shelling during the
afternoon, which did considerable further damage to the
Battalion's trenches. During the night a storm of terrific
intensity burst over Fonquevillers, adding to the general
discomfort by filling the trenches with water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>The two remaining days spent by the Battalion in this
sector were occupied in continuing the work of removing
the dead, baling out and clearing blocked trenches,
and generally attempting to reorganise the broken-down
defences as well as possible.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 6th July the 168th Brigade was
relieved in Z sector, as the 46th Divisional line was called,
by the 169th, and the Battalion, handing over its trenches
to the Queen's Westminsters, moved by platoons into
billets at St Amand, a welcome issue of dry underclothing
being issued to the troops on arrival.</p>

<p>At this point the Battalion may be said finally to have
finished its share in the battle of the 1st July. Although
not detailed as one of the assaulting battalions in the
attack, the strain to which it was subjected both in actual
hard work prior to the battle and by reason of the enemy
fire during the action, was as heavy as that borne by any
unit of the Division, while its casualties were among the
most severe. Starting at Bayencourt on the 13th June
the Battalion had supplied heavy working parties with
long hours of work and with a three-mile march in each
direction to and from work for fourteen nights in succession,
always harassed by the enemy fire and frequently wet
through. For three nights of unusual enemy activity
they had held the line prior to the battle, and this duty
was followed without respite by the day of battle itself.
After a brief interlude of two days in billets it had once
more returned to the trenches on the additional and
unexpected duty at Fonquevillers, and had there passed
a further four days in extreme discomfort&mdash;a record of
which we think any battalion might justly be proud.</p>

<p>The extended front now held by the Division rendered
a prolonged rest for the Brigade out of the question, and
the Battalion's sojourn at St Amand was of only three
days' duration. Of these days the first two were occupied
in refitting the troops as far as possible, and in cleaning
up and drying clothing after the days spent in the line.
The last day, Sunday 9th July, was occupied with Church
Parade and, in the afternoon, a Brigade Parade at Souastre
for inspections by the Corps and Army Commanders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
both of whom addressed the Brigade in congratulatory
terms.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 10th the 168th Brigade returned
to the trenches at Hébuterne, there relieving the
167th. An adjustment of sectors was now effected as a
result of which the 168th Brigade held the right sector
of the Divisional front, comprising the old W sector and
the part of Y sector south of the Hébuterne-Gommecourt
Road; in the centre was the 167th Brigade between the
Hébuterne-Gommecourt and the Fonquevillers-Gommecourt
Roads; while the 169th Brigade held the left of
the Divisional front.</p>

<p>The 168th front was occupied by the London Scottish
in the right subsector and the Kensingtons on the left.
The 1/4th Londons took over billets at Bayencourt, while
the Rangers moved to Sailly.</p>

<p>On the 17th the Battalion relieved the London Scottish
in the right subsector of the Brigade front, the relief being
complete by 6 p.m. The same day the Rangers took over
the left subsector from the Kensingtons.</p>

<p>The principal operation carried out by the Battalion
during this tour of duty was the filling in of the advanced
front line. This had been so seriously damaged during
the battle as to become almost untenable, and the labour
which would be involved in its repair and maintenance
did not appear to be justifiable. Accordingly the task of
filling it and the communication trenches as far back as
the WS line was carried out on the night 18/19th July.
The portion from Whisky Street southwards was dealt
with by 2 officers and 140 men of C Company, while the
part north of Whisky Street was filled in by 120 men of
the Kensingtons. A covering party in No Man's Land of 2
platoons' strength secured the safety of the working party.</p>

<p>This step clearly indicated that all ideas of an advance
on this front were&mdash;for the moment at any rate&mdash;given up,
but the rôle played by the Division during the remainder
of its duty at Hébuterne was such as to foster an offensive
spirit in the troops by means of constant patrolling
activity and a general policy of aggression against the
enemy's defences and working parties. This rôle was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
more important on account of the striking developments
which were occurring in the British offensive operations
nearer the Somme, where the pressure which was being
brought to bear on the Germans was severe and continually
increasing. Gradually the enemy was being compelled
to push his reserves into the fight and limit as far
as possible his activities on other parts of the front. Any
action at Hébuterne, therefore, which could prevent the
withdrawal of the opposing garrison to the battle area
further south had a direct and important bearing on the
fortunes of the British arms.</p>

<p>On the nights of the 20th, 21st and 22nd July strong
patrols were sent out from the Battalion under 2/Lieuts.
W. E. Osborne, H. W. Vernon and J. C. Graddon respectively,
with the object of securing a live prisoner captured
from a German patrol. No success, however, was achieved.</p>

<p>On the 23rd July an inter-battalion relief again took
place and the Battalion was relieved by the London
Scottish withdrawing on relief to Brigade support billets
at Sailly, but leaving B Company in the Keep in Hébuterne
to furnish working parties.</p>

<p>The Battalion remained in Sailly supplying working
parties in the forward area until the end of July.
Advantage was taken of this period out of the line to
straighten out some "cross-postings" which had occurred
among drafts of N.C.O.'s and men recently sent up from
the Base, and drafts of Queen's Westminsters and 3rd
London men were despatched from the Battalion to rejoin
their own units. At the same time the Battalion received
drafts of 4th London men from the Queen Victorias and
the Kensingtons, to whom they had been sent in error.</p>

<p>On the last day of July the Battalion once more took
over from the London Scottish the right subsector of
W sector, B and C Companies occupying the WR line as
the most advanced position with A Company in support
and D in reserve.</p>

<p>During the ensuing tour of duty the work of trench
repairing, wiring and patrolling was actively prosecuted,
but no incident worthy of record occurred. The enemy's
activity, both in artillery and trench mortar fire, became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
rather more marked, and Hébuterne itself attracted more
attention than had been the case prior to the battle. The
enemy's shell fire produced, however, an ample measure
of retaliation from our guns, which bombarded his trenches
with good results.</p>

<p>On the 4th August the Battalion withdrew again to
Brigade reserve at Bayencourt, handing over its trenches
to the London Scottish, and was employed in furnishing
working parties and in training.</p>

<p>Since the 1st July the Battalion had received some
very valuable reinforcements of officers which repaired
the deficiencies caused by the battle, as follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent8">

<p>13th July&mdash;Capt. F. C. J. Read from the 2/4th Battalion,
Lieut. A. G. Sharp, 2/Lieuts. P. F. Smalley,
J. C. Graddon, Y. R. Oldrey, W. H. Calnan,
C. E. Lewis, W. E. Osborne, J. W. Chapman,
F. J. Foden, C. F. English and J. T. Middleton
from the Reserve Battalion.</p>

<p>16th July&mdash;2/Lieut. G. E. Stanbridge from the Reserve
Battalion.</p>

<p>6th August&mdash;2/Lieut. F. R. R. Burford from the 3/4th Battalion,
2/Lieuts. C. J. Brodie, O. D. Garratt, C. H. T.
Heaver, A. Potton, W. Quennell and C. M.
Taylor from the Reserve Battalion.</p>

<p>7th August&mdash;2/Lieuts. C. W. Denning, M.M., S. J. Barkworth,
M.M., E. McD. McCormick, T. B. Cooper, M.M.,
W. H. Davey, D.C.M., C. F. Mortleman commissioned
direct from the 1/20th Londons.</p>

<p>9th August&mdash;2/Lieuts. N. A. Ormiston, R. E. Grimsdell and
W. Richards from the Reserve Battalion.</p>

<p>10th August&mdash;2/Lieut. J. W. Price from Hospital and 2/Lieut.
L. W. Archer, commissioned from the ranks
of the Battalion.</p></div>

<p>On the 5th July a draft of 60, of whom 58 were
N.C.O.'s, arrived from the 2/4th Battalion, a particularly
welcome addition to the strength in view of the losses
which had been sustained. Early in July Lieut. L. G.
Rix, the Transport Officer, had been appointed Brigade
Transport Officer, and his place in the Battalion was filled
by Lieut. G. V. Lawrie, attached from the Scottish Rifles.</p>

<p>2/Lieut. N. W. Williams was wounded at Fonquevillers
on the 6th July, and on the 18th the Battalion
suffered a further great loss in the Quartermaster, Lieut.
E. S. Tomsett, who completely broke down in health<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
and was invalided to England. Tomsett had filled the
appointment of Quartermaster with great credit since
November 1913, and had served over thirteen years with
the Battalion, his previous service having been with the
Rifle Brigade. On recovery from his illness Tomsett was
granted a combatant commission in recognition of his
services and appointed to command the depôt at Hoxton.
His duties as Quartermaster in the 1/4th Battalion were
taken over by Lieut. H. B. A. Balls.</p>

<p>The 10th August found the Battalion once more&mdash;and
for the last time&mdash;resuming possession of W sector, the
relief of the London Scottish being completed by 4.45 p.m.
During the progress of the relief Hébuterne was intermittently
shelled and a direct hit was scored on Battalion
Headquarters, though fortunately without inflicting
casualties. A six-day tour of duty produced but little
of interest beyond the usual trench routine. Patrolling
in No Man's Land was actively pursued, and resulted in
establishing definitely the energy being displayed by the
Germans in repairing their defences, and also their
acquiescence in our possession of No Man's Land, which
seemed to be undisputed. The German artillery continued
to shell Hébuterne and the Orchard, near Cross Street, a
good deal, while his constant machine-gun fire at night
interfered seriously with our work of wiring in front of
W 48.</p>

<p>On the 12th Major-Gen. Hull presented ribands to those
who had been decorated for their work on the 1st July,
the presentation being made on the football field at
Bayencourt.</p>

<p>A warning order had now been received that the
Division was to be relieved by the 17th Division and to
withdraw for training in rear of the line, in the St Riquier
area near Abbeville.</p>

<p>The 168th Brigade was to concentrate at Halloy before
proceeding to the new area, and the first step in this concentration
was the relief on the 16th August of the 1/4th
Londons and Rangers by the London Scottish and
Kensingtons respectively. On relief the 1/4th Londons
moved to billets in Sailly, leaving C Company at the Keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
in Hébuterne for working parties until the 18th, when the
whole Battalion marched at 7 p.m. to Halloy, arriving in
huts there at 11 p.m. By the 21st the whole Brigade
group was completely out of the line and the following
day moved to the new area, the Battalion entraining at
Doullens at 11.40 a.m. and, detraining at St Riquier
shortly before 6 p.m., marched thence to billets at Le
Plessiel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

THE 1/4TH BATTALION IN THE BATTLES OF THE SOMME, 1916</h2>


<h3>II. <em>The Battles of September and October</em></h3>

<p>As we have pointed out in the preceding chapter, the
1st July was a day of almost complete check to the British
attack from Fricourt northwards. Between Fricourt and
the Somme, however, a certain measure of success had been
attained, while south of the river the French had made a
considerable advance.</p>

<p>This limited success was exploited to the fullest extent
during the first half of July, and by the 14th, after very
fierce fighting, in which eleven British Divisions were
engaged, our lines were pressed forward through the series
of fortresses forming the first German system of defence.</p>

<p>The Main Ridge of the Somme watershed runs east-south-east
from Thiepval, above the Ancre, across the
Albert-Bapaume Road, towards the Péronne-Bapaume
Road. About a mile and a half west of the latter road it
is completely severed by a narrow and deep ravine in which
lies the small township of Combles; and about half way
between Combles and Thiepval it is deeply indented by
a valley which separates the villages of Bazentin-le-Grand
and Bazentin-le-Petit, the head of this valley being
dominated by the high ground on which stands High
Wood. The ridge, therefore, divides itself into three
sections, all on the same general alignment, as follows:
In the west, from Thiepval, astride the Albert-Bapaume
Road to High Wood; in the centre, from High Wood to
the Combles Valley; in the east, the high ground about
Sailly Saillisel on the Péronne-Albert Road.</p>

<p>The German second system of defences followed roughly
the near side of the crest of this Main Ridge, including the
villages (from east to west) of Maurepas, Guillemont,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Longueval (with Delville Wood), the Bazentins and
Pozières. The third system lay on the further slope of
the ridge and included the villages of Morval, Lesbœufs,
Flers and Gueudecourt.</p>

<p>On the 14th July the British attacked the second
system on a front from Bazentin-le-Petit to Longueval.
This attack, which was successful, was pressed forward
to High Wood, of which practically the whole was captured,
and thus secured for us a footing on the Main Ridge,
dividing the German forces on the west and centre portions
of it. The advance was consolidated and rounded off
locally in the direction of Guillemont; but the new
positions formed an abrupt and narrow salient in our line,
and before a further advance to the German third system
could be contemplated it was necessary for the British
hold on the Main Ridge to be widened. It was considered
by G.H.Q. that the Pozières-Thiepval series of fortresses
at the western extremity of the ridge was too powerful to
yield to frontal attack, and it was therefore decided to
extend the hold on the centre portion of the ridge. This
postulated the capture of Guillemont, Ginchy and Combles,
and a swinging-up of the British right flank which rested
on the Combles valley. The French were to co-operate
on the right of the Combles valley by the capture of
Frégicourt and Rancourt. Combles itself, immensely
fortified and strongly garrisoned, was too formidable an
obstacle to be likely to fall into our hands by direct attack,
except at an appalling cost of life; and it was therefore
to be enveloped, the British advancing on the heights west
of it and the French to its east.</p>

<p>It is with this great outflanking movement for the
capture of Combles and the securing of the Main Ridge
immediately west of it that the 56th Division and the
Guillemont was first attacked on the 23rd July, but it
was not until after repeated attempts that it finally fell
into our hands on the 3rd September. On that day the
line was advanced to the outskirts of Ginchy and to the
Wedge Wood-Ginchy Road, Falfemont Farm falling to
us on the 5th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile local improvements had been made in our
positions in various parts of the line, and the bitter fighting
of August, though productive of no very deep advance
was of the greatest value. It not only widened our hold
on the ridge, but also by a series of unrelenting sledgehammer
blows had a cumulative effect on the German
morale and thus paved the way for the greater successes
of September.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The 168th Brigade continued training in the St Riquier
area until the end of August, the 1/4th Londons retaining
their billets at Le Plessiel. The training was rendered
peculiarly interesting by reason of the first appearance
of the "Heavy Section Machine-Gun Corps," better known
as Tanks. These engines of war, which were regarded at
first by the troops with a good deal of wonderment and
not a little misgiving, only arrived in France on the
25th August. No time was lost in testing them and
giving infantry troops an opportunity to co-operate with
them in practice prior to their employment in action.</p>

<p>The 56th Division received the compliment of being
one of the units selected by G.H.Q. to co-operate with
Tanks on the occasion of their first appearance in battle,
and accordingly a series of practice schemes was begun on
the 26th August, the Brigades of the 56th Division being
employed in turn. Needless to say the interest aroused by
the strange appearance of these iron monsters was intense
and speculation was rife as to their potential value in
action, not only among the troops, but also among the
many staff officers who were present at the demonstrations.
Unfortunately the time allowed for "tuning up" the
engines was inadequate, the result being that during the
first practices the Tanks showed a most undesirable
predilection for breaking down&mdash;a habit not calculated to
inspire with confidence the infantry who were expected
to follow them. However, these difficulties were largely
overcome, and by the 2nd September, when the 168th
Brigade's turn for practising with them arrived, the Tanks
were working well.</p>

<p>In spite of the misgivings as to the tactical value of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the Tanks which presented themselves to the minds of
those inclined to pessimism, their arrival undoubtedly
gave enormous encouragement to the troops who were
enabled at last to realise that the enemy were not always
to be first in the field with new inventions; and the
anticipation of a great surprise effect when the Tanks
should first appear before the enemy trenches brought all
ranks to the tip-toe of expectation. The strict injunction
which was issued to avoid mention of the Tanks in correspondence
was most loyally obeyed.</p>

<p>On the 2nd September a warning order was received
that the Division would move forward to the battle area,
and the following day the 168th and 169th Brigades moved
to the Corbie area. The Battalion left Le Plessiel in the
afternoon of the 3rd, marching to St Riquier, where it
entrained for Corbie, a town of some size at the confluence
of the Ancre and the Somme. Here the Battalion detrained
at 11.15 p.m., marching, with the Rangers, to
billets at Vaux-sur-Somme. The remainder of the Brigade
was accommodated a mile further forward at Sailly-le-Sec.</p>

<p>The Division now came under the orders of the XIV
Corps (Cavan), the extreme right of the British Army,
consisting of the 5th, 16th and 20th Divisions, which had
this day been operating on the Guillemont front in the
action already alluded to.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 4th orders were received, without
any previous intimation that they might be coming, for
the Battalion to move forward at once. The whole
Battalion, less personnel of the transport and vehicles,
marched out of Vaux-sur-Somme within one hour of the
receipt of these orders&mdash;a credit to the high state of
organisation to which the Battalion had been trained since
leaving the Hébuterne area. Boutall writes: "The
march was a long and tedious one and I think I am right
in asserting that not a single man fell out on the way. I
distinctly remember Lieut.-Col. Wheatley congratulating
himself on the fact."</p>

<p>This march terminated at a large concentration camp
known as the Citadel about two miles north of Bray. At
the Citadel the Battalion was able to form a vague idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
for the first time of the enormous effort being put forth
by the British in this already long drawn-out struggle.
The concentration camp covered an enormous area on the
rolling hillsides above the Somme and presented an
astounding spectacle of numbers of units from every
arm of the Service&mdash;gunners, infantry, engineers&mdash;besides
vast stores of materials of all kinds. The roar of the guns
in the inferno of the battle line seemed to speak to the
troops of the great and yet increasing power of the British
Armies, and filled every heart with hope and confidence.
To many of those who remembered the lean days of 1915
when the British battle line was starved for men and shells,
this first contact with the reality of the Empire's strength
was almost overpowering.</p>

<p>On the 5th September the Division took the place in
Corps Reserve of the 20th Division, which had been withdrawn
from the fighting line, and in the evening of the
same day the relief of the 5th Division in the line began.</p>

<p>The front taken over from the 5th Division was the
extreme right of the line from its junction with the
French, overlooking the Combles valley to the left of
Leuze Wood. The 169th Brigade (relieving the 15th)
took over the right sector and the 168th Brigade (relieving
the 95th) assumed responsibility in the left sector.</p>

<p>September had set in with steady rain which had
already converted all the roads, tracks and camping
grounds into seas of liquid mud. The Battalion, which
since arrival at the Citadel had been held at short notice
to move, advanced during the afternoon of the 5th, in full
battle kit in the direction of the line. The state of the
ground made marching an impossibility, and after sliding
along for some time uncomfortably in the mud, orders
were received for the Battalion to return to the Citadel.
The change of plan was, as usual, received with philosophical
resignation, and the men turned in to take
advantage of the short respite only to be roused again a
few hours later the same evening when the advance to
the line began at 11.15 p.m.</p>

<p>At this hour the Battalion, which with the Rangers
was in Brigade support, left the Citadel, arriving in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
allotted position in Casement Trench at 5.30 a.m. on the
6th September. This trench was now reduced to a series
of shell holes which the bad weather had rendered most
uncomfortable, and was a part of the original German
system opposite Maricourt.</p>

<p>The departure from the Citadel was marked by a most
unfortunate accident. As the column began to move the
explosion of a bomb which had been left buried in the mud
occurred at the head of D Company, and this very seriously
wounded Capt. A. L. Long, the company commander, and
2/Lieut. A. G. Sharp, and caused casualties to 19 N.C.O.'s
and men.</p>

<p>With the advent of daylight the Battalion first came
face to face with the ghastly desolation of the Somme
battlefield. In all directions every sort of landmark
seemed to be obliterated. A few torn stumps marked
what had been Bernafay and Trones Woods, the village
of Guillemont was practically effaced, and the only signs
of life in the neighbourhood of the Battalion were numerous
batteries of artillery in action. Here the nucleus personnel
left the Battalion and returned to the Citadel, where the
Q.M. stores were established. At 2 p.m. the Battalion
changed its position to Chimpanzee Trench in the neighbourhood
of the Brickfield, south of Bernafay Wood, and
here it received a foretaste of the German barrage. After
dark the forward move was resumed, and the Battalion
entered the support trenches in rear of Leuze Wood,
on the Wedge Wood-Ginchy Road, relieving the 4th
Gloucesters. This trench formed a "switch" in the
second German system which had fallen into our hands
on the 3rd September.</p>


<h3><em>The Battle of Ginchy, 5th-10th September</em></h3>

<p>The disposition of the Brigade was now as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<ul>
  <li>In front line, Leuze Wood:&mdash;London Scottish.</li>
  <li>In support, Wedge Wood-Ginchy Road:&mdash;1/4th Londons.</li>
  <li>In reserve, Maltzhorn Farm:&mdash;Rangers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="hangindent">

<p>The Kensingtons were attached to the 169th Brigade, and were
in line to the south of Leuze Wood.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>During the night the enemy's bombardment of the
front line and Wedge Wood Valley increased in intensity
and two platoons of the 1/4th Londons, under Lieuts.
Oldrey and Garratt, were ordered forward to reinforce
the Scottish in Leuze Wood. This advance was successfully
accomplished, the platoons managing to get through
an unpleasantly heavy barrage with only one casualty.
No enemy attack materialised, and towards dawn, the
hostile bombardment having subsided, the two platoons
rejoined the Battalion.</p>

<p>Throughout the 7th September and far into the night
the enemy shelled Wedge Wood Valley and the support
line heavily, and the Battalion suffered a good many
casualties, chiefly among ration and water-carrying parties,
while communication with Battalion Headquarters was
exceedingly difficult. The Wedge Wood-Ginchy Road
which ran immediately in front of the trench was sunken
at this point, and the bank was honeycombed with German
dugouts, among them one which had been used as an
aid-post, and which produced an ample supply of bandages,
lint and field-dressings, and also cigars and tobacco&mdash;trench
stores which were promptly taken on charge by the
Battalion.</p>

<p>The road itself was littered with German dead, the
remnants of the battle of the 3rd, who had apparently
been caught by our barrage, of the destructive nature of
which evidences were everywhere to be seen. "Unfortunately,"
writes an eyewitness, "the sunken road was
an attraction to countless flies in the daytime. So
numerous were they that from the road arose a continuous
hum which was audible at a considerable distance. They
swarmed over into the trench and settled on our food in
such numbers that they often found their way into our
mouths at mealtimes."</p>

<p>During the afternoon of the 7th orders were issued for
the 56th Division to extend its front to the left by taking
over the sector held by the right Brigade of the 16th
Division. This consisted of a trench following the Leuze
Wood-Guillemont Road, from near the north corner of
Leuze Wood, for about 500 yards to the left. This relief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
was to be effected by "side-stepping" the 168th Brigade
to the left, its trenches in Leuze Wood being handed
over to the 169th Brigade. In pursuance of this
scheme the Battalion took over with A and D Companies
the advanced front line&mdash;about 200 yards' frontage
on the immediate left of Leuze Wood&mdash;from the 7th
Inniskilling Fusiliers. Immediately after relief these companies
began to dig assembly trenches for the impending
continuance of the offensive, and this task was completed
before dawn on the 8th September. The Rangers meanwhile
had come up in line on the left of the 1/4th Londons,
while the Scottish on relief in Leuze Wood by the 169th
Brigade had withdrawn into Brigade support, where they
were joined by the Kensingtons.</p>

<p>The 8th September was occupied in improving the
assembly trenches, and in establishing an advanced report
centre in a German dugout at the south-west corner of
Leuze Wood&mdash;by now corrupted by the ever-ready wit of
the Cockney into "Lousy" Wood&mdash;while under cover of
darkness the Cheshire Pioneers connected the Wood with
Wedge Wood by a communication trench. In addition a
great deal of work was carried out in collecting advanced
dumps of tools, bombs, ammunition and water, in the
west edge of Leuze Wood. All this work was effected
under very heavy shell fire under which the Battalion
sustained some loss.</p>

<p>Orders had now been received for the resumption of
the offensive on the 9th, and during the night the 1/4th
Londons and Rangers occupied their newly dug assembly
trenches, while the Kensingtons advanced to the Wedge
Wood support trench, the Scottish remaining at Maltzhorn
Farm. The advanced report centre in Leuze Wood was
taken over by the 1/4th Londons and placed under charge
of Capt. Houlder (17th Londons attached). Capt. Houlder,
who could speak German fluently, was instrumental during
the action in gaining from prisoners much useful first-hand
information which he was able to pass back to Battalion
and Brigade Headquarters. The terrifying aspect of this
huge British officer, coupled with the fact that he always
had a loaded revolver conspicuously displayed during his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
investigations, no doubt increased the desire of his victims
to respond to his enquiries!</p>

<p>The battle of the 9th September was an attack on the
whole front of the Fourth Army, the French co-operating
on our right. The object of the XIV Corps, of which the
56th and 16th Divisions were in line, was to advance the
British positions from the Combles valley on the extreme
right well to the east of Leuze Wood on a line running
from south-east to north-west as far as the Ginchy-Morval
Road, which formed the left of the 56th Division front.
From this point the 16th Division was to reach a line
which ran due west for some 800 yards along the road
towards Ginchy and then bent northwards to include the
whole of the village.</p>

<p>Map No. 5 shows the objectives of the 56th Division,
the 169th Brigade on the right being responsible for forcing
our lines forward of Leuze Wood on its north and east
sides; and the 168th Brigade continuing the line as far as
Point 141·7 on the Ginchy-Morval Road. The map also
indicates that nearly every battalion taking part in the
assault would have to make a change of direction from its
starting point in order to advance to its objective.</p>

<p>So far as the 168th Brigade was concerned the advance
was to be made in two stages, the first objective being a
line of German trenches, running from the north corner of
Leuze Wood towards Ginchy, and the final objective being
as above described. For this purpose the dispositions of
the Brigade remained as they had been on the eve of the
battle, that is:</p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons were disposed for attack as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<ul>
  <li>Right&mdash;B Company (Lieut. H. W. Vernon).</li>
  <li>Centre&mdash;D Company (Lieut. G. H. Davis).</li>
  <li>Left&mdash;A Company (Capt. J. R. Webster).</li>
  <li>Support&mdash;C Company (2/Lieut. W. E. Osborne).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Each company occupied a two-platoon frontage, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
that the whole Battalion was on a front of six platoons
and in a depth of four waves.</p>

<p>The morning of the 9th September dawned mistily,
but by 10 o'clock the sun's rays had dispersed the haze
and disclosed to the enemy the new earth thrown up in
front of our hastily dug assembly trenches. A heavy
bombardment of the assembly areas on the whole Divisional
front followed, lasting all the morning and causing
a good many casualties. The assaulting companies having
already formed up over night, the trenches were crowded
with troops waiting for the hour of attack, and the experience
of having quietly to endure this remarkably
accurate and heavy shoot was one of the most trying of
the whole engagement.</p>

<p>At 4 o'clock the enemy put down a heavy barrage on
our lines. A quarter of an hour later our preparatory
bombardment, which had opened at 10 a.m., increased to
"hurricane" intensity, and for half an hour the German
positions were subjected to a frightful ordeal under which
it seemed that nothing could live. At 4.45 p.m. the
British columns, on a front of several miles, moved to the
assault.</p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons on getting out of their assembly
trenches had to make a change of direction, pivoting on
their right flank, and this accomplished, they moved
forward steadily, keeping well up to their barrage and
suffering comparatively little loss.</p>

<p>In consequence of the conflicting reports which were
received during the action, the heavy toll of casualties
in all ranks, and the resultant intermingling of companies
in the positions gained, it has been a matter of considerable
difficulty to elucidate the position and to extract from
the mass of evidence a fair and impartial account of what
really occurred.</p>

<p>It seems evident, however, that the position marked
as the 1/4th Londons' first objective was innocent of the
trench which it was expected to find there. At all events
if a trench had ever existed on the line of the Leuze Wood-Ginchy
track it had been so battered by shell fire as to be
no longer recognisable as such; and it appears that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
greater part of the assaulting companies overshot the
mark and moved straight on to what was really the second
objective, which they occupied under the impression that
it was the first objective. It had been arranged that
A Company on the left should consolidate a strong point
on the left of the real first objective at its point of junction
with the sector to be captured by the Rangers. Evidently
2/Lieut. Brodie, to whom was allotted this task, in making
his change of direction to the right took a somewhat wide
sweep and struck the east end of the Rangers' first objective,
where a trench did actually exist, and here he formed
his block practically in the position where it was intended
to be. Subsequently Brodie, finding himself, no doubt,
out of touch with the remainder of the Battalion, who had
gone too far, came forward in the attempt to clear up the
situation, but unhappily was killed, together with all
his men.</p>

<p>The too rapid advance of the Battalion naturally
brought them under the fire of our own barrage, and
during the forty minutes' pause which was ordered after
the capture of the first objective before the resumption
of the advance on to the second, a good many casualties
did in fact occur from our own shells which were dropping
in and uncomfortably close to the trench which was
occupied. This trench&mdash;the real second objective&mdash;was
subsequently known as Bully Trench. We will therefore
so refer to it in order to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>At 5.25 p.m. the Battalion, now including elements
of all companies, once more advanced in a commendably
steady manner on to a trench just topping the rise of the
Main Ridge. This it occupied with very little opposition.
This advanced position&mdash;Beef Trench&mdash;was an isolated
trench about 150 yards ahead of Bully (the real second
objective) with both flanks in the air. It was shallow
and evidently only in course of construction. It afforded
magnificent observation over the rearward slopes of the
Main Ridge on to the German third line system in front
of Morval, and in this position the work of consolidation
was begun, two Lewis gun posts being pushed forward
overlooking the Morval-Lesbœufs Road. Middle Copse, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
small spinney about 200 yards to the front, was seen to be
teeming with Bosche who were effectively dealt with by
our Lewis guns.</p>

<p>In the meantime the right platoon of B Company under
2/Lieut. Garratt, which, in keeping touch with the Queen
Victorias, had got ahead of the rest of the Battalion, had
evidently become deflected slightly to the right during
its advance and had dropped into the communication
trench connecting Leuze Wood with Bully Trench. Apparently
somewhat confusing his direction in the total
absence of landmarks, Garratt moved along this trench
and turned the corner to the left along Bully Trench.
Here he came in contact with a Bosche bombing party,
and attacking them vigorously pushed them back for some
considerable distance, and eventually constructed a temporary
block in the trench, probably about the centre of the
Battalion's sector, <em>i.e.</em> about 200 yards short of the Quadrilateral.
In this bomb fighting the men of B Company
displayed great courage and dash, and their accurate
throwing contributed largely to their success. Among these
gallant men Corpl. Udall was conspicuous, and for his
devotion to duty he was awarded the Military Medal.</p>

<p>During the advance of the assaulting companies of
the Battalion from Bully Trench to the advanced position
in Beef, a somewhat determined attack was delivered
against B Company's block by a large party of the enemy
led by an officer. Fortunately the shallowness of the
trench exposed the enemy's advance and after a brisk
exchange of bombs, in the course of which some loss was
inflicted on the attacking party, including the officer who
was shot by Garratt, the survivors surrendered with the
exception of a few who fled pursued by the fire of our men
and the Rangers. Garratt was subsequently awarded
the Military Cross for his good work.</p>

<p>On the Battalion's left the Rangers, whose line of
advance was dominated by the Quadrilateral and a small
spur running from it in a south-westerly direction, had
been faced with a withering machine-gun fire under which
advance was utterly impossible. Their left company was
unable to make progress, and by 8.30 p.m. was compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
to withdraw to its assembly positions in conjunction with
the right Brigade of the 16th Division who had also been
unable to overcome the German resistance. The right
company of the Rangers pushed gallantly forward losing
heavily, but was finally brought to a stand in the vicinity
of the temporary block which was being held in Bully by
Garratt. Here they were forced to take such cover as shell
craters afforded them, and to reply to the Bosche fire, in
which they were assisted by the party of B Company at
the block. Under the gathering darkness a good many
of the Rangers were able to make their way into Bully
trench.</p>

<p>While all this was taking place two companies of the
Kensingtons had occupied the assembly trenches vacated
by the 1/4th Londons, and the commanders of these,
appreciating the situation of the Rangers, at once made a
gallant attempt to fill the gap on the left. Their gallantry,
however, cost them dear, and the German barrage took a
heavy toll of casualties before they reached Bully Trench.
The bravery of Major Dickens was in particular remarkable.
Mortally wounded some time before he reached his
objective, he continued to advance at the head of his men,
cheering and encouraging them until he collapsed into
the trench. Later in the evening the two remaining companies
of the Kensingtons were also thrown into the fight
and became absorbed into the 1/4th Londons' position in
Bully Trench.</p>

<p>Darkness had now fallen, and the position of the companies
in the advanced trench was far from happy. Both
flanks were in the air and heavy losses had been suffered;
of the officers who had started with these companies, only
four&mdash;Cooper, McCormick, Quennell and Burford&mdash;were still
standing. News from Garratt showed that he was doubtful
as to whether he could hold out against another attack.</p>

<p>Fearing to lose the advantage already gained, Cooper,
who had assumed command of the force in Beef Trench,
decided to reoccupy Bully temporarily, and finally clear it
of the enemy. The withdrawal was successfully accomplished
in the dark, but the enemy was found to be firmly
established with an apparently ample supply of bombs on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
his side of the block, which had now been completed with
the help of the Kensington and Ranger reinforcements;
and further attempts to extend our gains northward in
Bully were abandoned. Communication being now re-established
with Battalion Headquarters, orders were
received in Bully for the reoccupation of the advanced
positions in Beef; and the Bully position being now much
strengthened by Rangers and Kensingtons, the 1/4th
Londons moved forward alone to Beef Trench.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the night a good deal of work
was necessary in reorganising the somewhat mixed force
by which the forward position was now occupied. One or
two enemy patrols approached the position but were fired
on and dispersed, and apart from continued shell fire and
sniping the night passed comparatively peacefully.</p>

<p>Captain Cooper gives the following account of a remarkable
incident which occurred during the night:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A glow was seen in a shell hole some distance to the
front and on investigation this proved to be from the
cigarette of a battalion N.C.O., a corporal (Fergusson),
who had formed part of one of the forward posts. He
had become separated from his men and wounded in the
back so that he was unable to walk. He stated that he
had been uncertain of his position and so had crawled
into a shell hole. A Bosche patrol had found him and
removed his shoulder badges and taken the contents of
his pockets, but had propped him up in a comfortable
position and had left him his water-bottle, cigarettes and
matches. He was calmly and coolly enjoying a cigarette
when found. He was sent on a stretcher to the Aid Post.</p></div>

<p>While these events were taking place on the Battalion's
front, the Queen Victorias, the left of the 169th Brigade,
had occupied their objective, and were in touch on the
right of Bully. The enemy, however, had hitherto successfully
resisted all efforts of the London Rifle Brigade to
emerge from the east side of Leuze Wood. At about 7 p.m.
the Bosche at this part of the line had launched a vigorous
bomb attack along the sunken road leading from Combles,
and the L.R.B. had been forced back after a most stubborn
resistance which cost them heavily. During the night the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Queen's Westminsters took over the extreme right of the
Division.</p>

<p>The 16th Division on the left had also met with varied
fortunes. The 47th Brigade on its left had successfully
advanced through Ginchy and established itself on its
objective; but the right brigade, the 48th, whose objective
lay along the Ginchy-Morval Road, met with most stubborn
resistance from the spur already referred to. In spite of
the most gallant efforts the Brigade was unable to make
progress, and eventually fell back with the left wing of the
Rangers at about 8.30 p.m. and reoccupied their original
position on the Wedge Wood-Ginchy Road. About this
time the London Scottish were ordered into the fight in
order to endeavour to clear up the situation in this part of
the field. After the march forward from Maltzhorn their
preparations were completed at about midnight, and
shortly after they attacked from a position to the left of
the Rangers' assembly trenches towards the Quadrilateral.
The enemy was still vigorous in his defence, and after losing
their direction in the intense darkness, the Scottish were
ultimately withdrawn, having first rendered a good account
of themselves in a lively little hand-to-hand fight with a
party of the Bosche. During the night the 16th Division
was relieved by the 3rd Guards Brigade.</p>

<p>Shortly after dawn on the 10th 2/Lieut. McCormick,
who had come back to Battalion Headquarters with a
report of the situation, returned to Beef Trench with
orders for the immediate evacuation of the advanced
position. Accordingly, after establishing two Lewis gun
positions in Beef Trench, the withdrawal was proceeded
with as rapidly as possible, the activity of the German
snipers in the growing daylight making movement difficult
except in the smallest parties. The return of the 1/4th
Londons to Bully Trench caused congestion which was
subsequently intensified by the arrival of a large reinforcement
of London Scottish. This Battalion made efforts
during the day to prolong the line in the direction of the
Quadrilateral, while the Guards, working eastward along
the Ginchy-Morval Road, sought to join hands with them,
but the Germans were well supplied with bombs and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
up a very gallant resistance. The continued occupation
of the spur&mdash;which on the previous day had stopped the
16th Division&mdash;moreover forced an unpleasantly deep re-entrant
in the British line, leaving the left flank of the
1/4th Londons dangerously exposed. An effort to rout
out the pertinacious defenders of this spur was made
during the afternoon by the 168th Stokes mortars, who
fired 35 rounds with good effect into the enemy trenches.</p>

<p>The position on the right flank of the Battalion was
still less satisfactory than had been hoped for. At 7 a.m.
and again at 3 p.m. the Queen's Westminsters had made
local attempts to gain the previous day's objective, but
each time without success.</p>

<p>Throughout the day the Battalion's position was kept
under heavy German shell fire which caused the already
heavy casualty roll to mount higher and higher, and it was
found necessary to relieve the congestion in Bully by withdrawing
the Rangers and Kensingtons to the rear. Communication
with Headquarters was rendered exceedingly
difficult, though, as always, there was no lack of brave
volunteers to try to pass through the German barrage, and
these in some cases succeeded in reaching the report centre
in Leuze Wood. Moreover the trench, only a shallow and
half-finished work to start with, was becoming badly
shattered and was filled with wounded men, whom there
was no means of evacuating, for all the stretcher-bearers
with companies had themselves become casualties.
Throughout this trying day all ranks displayed magnificent
spirit and clung to their hardly won gains with grim
determination. That night the 168th Brigade was relieved,
the 1/4th Londons handing over their objective
to the 8th Middlesex of the 167th Brigade. Following
the relief, which was complete by midnight, the Battalion
moved by companies&mdash;by now sadly reduced in numbers&mdash;to
Casement Trench, whence the Battalion moved as a
unit to Billon Farm, near Carnoy, arriving in bivouacs
there at 5.30 a.m. on the 11th September.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>The five days' duty just completed were perhaps the
most strenuous the Battalion had yet experienced. Almost
all the time exposed to bad weather conditions and to
very heavy and accurate artillery fire, the spirit of the
men was magnificent; and their steadiness, after the loss
of 15 out of the 20 officers who led the companies into
action, as well as a large proportion of N.C.O.'s, was
unsurpassed. Their fighting qualities too were firmly
established, for they had taken their objectives up to
time-table and handed them over intact twenty-four
hours later. The total casualties during the five days
amounted to 22 officers and about 250 other ranks.</p>

<p>The officer casualties were as follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent8">

<p>7th and 8th September&mdash;Capts. F. O. J. Read and H. G. Stanham,
2/Lieuts. W. Richards, A. Potton, J. T. Middleton, C. H. T.
Heaver and L. W. Archer, wounded.</p>

<p>9th and 10th September&mdash;Capt. J. R. Webster, 2/Lieuts. C. J.
Brodie, F. J. Foden, W. E. Osborne, C. E. Lewis, C. S. G.
Blows and C. F. Mortleman, killed; Lieuts. H. W. Vernon
and G. H. Davis, 2/Lieuts. J. W. Price, V. R. Oldrey, C. F.
English, N. A. Ormiston and J. C. Graddon, wounded; and
2/Lieut. W. H. Davey, D.C.M., missing, presumed killed.</p></div>

<p>Throughout the 11th and 12th heavy fighting continued
in which the 167th Brigade co-operated with the Guards
on the left in numerous efforts to clear out the re-entrant
and reach the Ginchy Quadrilateral. This magnificently
defended position, however, held out against the most
gallant attempts of the attackers. During the night of
the 11/12th September the 167th Brigade was also relieved,
the line being taken over by the 16th Brigade of
the 6th Division.</p>

<p>The Battalion remained at Billon Farm for three most
welcome days of rest and reorganisation during which the
weather, which now once more became fine and warm,
was of inestimable value in cheering the troops after their
somewhat trying experience. The relief to the men's
spirits on emerging even for a short spell from the
ghastly featureless waste of the battle area to surroundings
where trees still bore their leaves, roads still crossed the
hillsides, and houses were not completely effaced, was
immense; and by the time the period of rest was over
the Battalion was once more braced up to continue the
struggle.</p>

<p>One or two changes occurred during this period among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the officers of the Battalion, of which the most important
was the assumption of the Adjutancy by Lieut. W. J.
Boutall on the evacuation to hospital of Capt. R. L. Herring,
who had occupied this trying position practically since
the Battalion joined the 56th Division. 2/Lieut. Garratt
assumed the duties of Assistant Adjutant almost immediately
afterwards. Capt. J. T. Sykes left the Battalion for
attachment to the Indian Army, and the signalling
officer, Lieut. E. W. Monk, to join the R.A.F. The latter's
duties were taken over by 2/Lieut. S. J. Barkworth, M.M.
In addition to these 2/Lieut. A. C. Knight was evacuated
to hospital.</p>


<h3><em>The Battle of Flers-Courcelette 15th-18th September</em></h3>

<p>The renewal of the offensive was not long to be delayed.
The object of the High Command was to follow up the
blows delivered against the German positions as rapidly
as possible, and to leave the enemy little respite for
reorganisation and rest. The constant hammering on his
defences had already had an appreciable effect on his
morale, and it was hoped that before long the strain on
his resources would prove so great that the situation would
develop rapidly in favour of the Allies.</p>

<p>The next general attack was arranged for the 15th
September, the assault being launched on the whole battle
front from Morval to Le Sars on the Albert-Bapaume Road.
The great pivoting movement by which the British right
flank was to be swung forward in line with the left on the
Main Ridge had now reached an important stage, and the
operations of the XIV Corps were now more than ever
bound up with the fortunes of the French south of Combles.
The French were aiming at establishing themselves astride
the Bapaume-Péronne Road at the village of Sailly Saillisel,
about two miles north-east of Combles; but the task presented
unusual difficulties owing to the restriction of the
lines of possible advance between the deep Combles ravine
on the one flank, and the extensive wood of St Pierre
Vaast on the other. The evils of this confinement were
aggravated by the fact that the enemy position about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Morval at the extreme east end of the Main Ridge
dominated the whole of our Allies' line of advance. It
was therefore essential to the success, not only of the
French in their ultimate object but also of the combined
"squeezing-out" process which was being applied to
Combles itself, that the British should at once possess
themselves of such portions of the Main Ridge as remained
in the enemy's hands. This entailed the breaking of the
Third German system on the line Morval-Lesbœufs-Flers,
and this was the task of the XIV and XV Corps on the
15th September.</p>

<p>The positions held by the Division at the opening of
the battle were as follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent8">

<p>167th Brigade&mdash;On the line north of Leuze Wood and intersecting
the south end of Bouleaux Wood which had
been captured on the 9th by the Queen Victorias,
and thence along the south-east edge of Leuze
Wood for about half its length.</p>

<p>169th Brigade&mdash;On the right of Leuze Wood, in a line running due
north and south, between the 167th and the
French.</p>

<p>168th Brigade&mdash;In reserve bivouacs in Angle Wood Valley, the
Battalion being at the head of the Valley near
Wedge Wood.</p></div>

<p>The position which the Battalion had captured on the
9th September was now held by the 6th Division, who
formed the centre of the Corps while the Guards were on
the extreme left.</p>

<p>The general idea of the attack was that the Guards and
6th Divisions should attack positions in the German third
line facing Lesbœufs, while the 56th Division was to form
a defensive flank facing the Combles ravine.</p>

<p>To establish this defensive flank the 169th Brigade on
the right was to push forward of Leuze Wood and occupy
a position roughly north and south with its left flank
astride the sunken road from Combles, about 300 yards
east of the edge of Leuze Wood. The 167th was to clear
Bouleaux Wood in two stages and establish a line parallel
to and about 100 yards in front of its east edge. The
1/4th Londons were to follow up the advance of the 167th
Brigade and then "leapfrog" through it on to the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
third line immediately in front of Morval whence they
would connect up between the left of the 167th Brigade
and the right of the 6th Division.</p>

<p>The 15th September was on the greater part of the
battle front a day of big successes. At an early hour
Flers fell before our assault, and by the afternoon the
British line had been pushed far beyond it; the whole of
High Wood was taken, and before nightfall Martinpuich
and Courcelette on the left had been added to the gains
of the day.</p>

<p>On the extreme right, however, the advance suffered a
rather severe check. The Guards, who occupied the left
of the Corps front, were able to make solid advances
between Flers and Lesbœufs, but the 6th Division adjoining
them were held up by the Quadrilateral at Ginchy, whose
brave defenders still maintained their position most
stubbornly; and this failure naturally reacted on the 56th
Division who occupied a narrow wedge between the Quadrilateral
and the Combles ravine.</p>

<p>At 5.50 a.m. the three tanks which were to make their
début with the Division left their departure points for the
first objective, and at 6.20 a.m. the infantry assault was
launched. Almost three hours later, at 9 a.m., the 1/4th
Londons left their bivouacs in Angle Wood Valley and
moved forward in artillery formation towards the battle
position on the crest between the north edge of Leuze
Wood and the west face of Bouleaux Wood. Progress
was not rapid owing to the heavy state of the ground, and
under the German shell fire a good many casualties were
sustained. The advance was made, however, in good
order, and with admirable steadiness.</p>

<p>The 169th Brigade made very slight advances on the
south of Leuze Wood; while the 167th managed to secure
the part of its first objective which lay outside Bouleaux
Wood. The 8th Middlesex of the latter Brigade even
made a heroic attempt to reach the second objective, but
had to be brought back. The enemy barrage was heavy
and fell, as it so often had in the Somme battles, between
the assaulting columns and their starting-point, thus
cutting them off from supplies and reinforcement, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the accurate intensity of their machine-gun fire from
their positions in the Quadrilateral made advance an utter
impossibility. After ten hours' fighting, during which the
assaulting Brigades did all that men could do, the Corps
Commander telephoned to Gen. Hull that the Division
would make no further attempt against Bouleaux Wood
that day.</p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons luckily avoided the slaughter of the
battle line this day, for a few minutes prior to its advance
from Angle Wood Valley an order had been despatched to
Brigade Headquarters to the effect that in consequence of
the check of the 6th Division in front of the Quadrilateral
the 168th Brigade would not occupy its battle position.
This order was transmitted by Brigade and reached the
Battalion during its advance. Upon receipt of it the
Battalion was at once brought back to its assembly area
at Angle Wood Valley where, in common with the remainder
of the Brigade, it remained in bivouacs till the
early hours of the 18th September. This operation cost
the Battalion a large number of casualties among N.C.O.'s
and men from the German shell fire, and one officer,
2/Lieut. J. W. Chapman, wounded.</p>

<p>During these days Angle Wood Valley was a distinctly
unhealthy locality. The German artillery maintained a
searching fire over the whole area, and exacted a fair toll
of casualties. The weather, which a few days previously
had shown signs of mending, had once more turned wet
and the shell holes, which formed the only available cover,
became not the most desirable resting-place for the troops.
The strain was great, but the situation was as usual not
only borne by all in the Battalion with an almost stoical
resignation, but enlivened occasionally with those rare
flashes of humour which have made the London soldiers
famous during the War in three continents.</p>

<p>The story of the tanks on the 15th September is too
well-known to need elaboration here, and is, moreover, too
much outside the actual experience of the Battalion to
allow of more than a passing reference. The moral effect
on the Germans was immense, and considering that their
employment had scarcely passed the experimental stage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the success gained by them was conspicuous. As was
anticipated, however, the tanks promptly became a mark
for a tremendous concentration of enemy fire which made
their room far more desirable than their company. Of
the three attached to the 56th Division one did useful work
in the vicinity of the Quadrilateral, and after trampling
down a good deal of wire and putting an enemy machine-gun
team out of action returned to make a personal
report of its adventures. The careers of the other two
were sadly abbreviated, and the end of the day found
them derelict&mdash;one west of Bouleaux Wood, and one
south-east of Leuze Wood&mdash;though not before they had
dealt out a certain amount of destruction to the German
defences.</p>

<p>Orders were received while the Battalion remained in
Angle Wood Valley for the resumption of the offensive on
the 18th September. The objectives on the XIV Corps
front were on this occasion very much more modest than
they had been three days earlier, and so far as the 56th
Division was concerned were as follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent8">

<p>169th Brigade&mdash;The sunken road from Leuze Wood to Combles,
between the east edge of the wood and the
orchard west of Combles.</p>

<p>67th Brigade&mdash;The east edge of Bouleaux Wood for a distance of
600 yards from its southern extremity, and
thence a line through the wood to Middle Copse.
From Middle Copse the objective was continued
in a northerly direction by the 6th Division.</p>

<p>The 168th Brigade remained in reserve in Angle Wood Valley,
but the 1/4th Londons and the London Scottish
were attached to the 167th.</p></div>

<p>For this operation the Battalion was detailed as the
left assaulting battalion of the 167th Brigade, its objective
being the portion between Middle Copse (which was held
by an advanced post of the 7th Middlesex) and the east
edge of Bouleaux Wood. For this purpose its assembly
position was the old German communication trench connecting
Bully Trench with the north corner of Leuze Wood.
The right of the Brigade frontage was taken up by the
3rd Londons.</p>

<p>The hour of assault was fixed for 6.15 a.m. on the 18th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
and to enable it to reach its assembly position by 5.15 a.m.
as ordered, the 1/4th Londons moved from Angle Wood
Valley at 3.30 a.m. But the ground was impossible. All
vestige of tracks had long since disappeared, and the
countryside in every direction was a vast slippery quagmire
in which so far from keeping any sort of march formation
it was next to impossible for the men, laden as they were
with battle equipment, to stand upright at all.</p>

<p>Zero hour arrived, but the Battalion as well as the 3rd
Londons was still slipping and struggling a long way
short of its assembly area. The British barrage opened
and was at once replied to by a withering machine-gun
fire by the enemy. Seldom has the Battalion been exposed
to so accurate and devastating a fire. The only alternative
to complete destruction was to take cover in the waterlogged
shell holes, which movement was carried out with
alacrity by all ranks: in this unexpected position an order
reached the Battalion abandoning the attack and recalling
it to Angle Wood.</p>

<p>On the right the much suffering 169th Brigade was
able to achieve a series of local bombing successes which
carried their line appreciably nearer Combles. From the
6th Division on the left, shortly after midday came the
cheering news that the Quadrilateral had at last fallen,
together with the trench to the north of it.</p>

<p>This important success, which had so long eluded the
grasp of the successive Divisions who had sought it, paved
the way for the magnificent achievements of the 25th
September, which will be recounted later, its especial
importance being that it was practically the last heavily
fortified stronghold on the central portion of the Main
Ridge to resist the British attacks.</p>

<p>The abortive operation of the 18th cost the Battalion
a good many casualties in N.C.O.'s and men, and one
officer, 2/Lieut. W. H. Calnan, wounded.</p>

<p>The same evening the 168th Brigade relieved the 167th
in the Leuze Wood trenches, the London Scottish occupying
the front system, which comprised Beef and Bully Trenches.
The 1/4th Londons took over from the 3rd Londons the
support line, which ran diagonally through Leuze Wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
in a north and south direction. Leuze Wood was at all
times an unhealthy locality and formed an unfailing source
of attraction for every conceivable sort of German
projectile. The 3rd Londons had already suffered heavily
here, and the night of the relief proved to be no exception
to the rule. Throughout the evening the wood was
plastered with high explosive shell, and even the inadequate
shelter of the trenches hastily dug, damaged and waterlogged
as they were, was exceedingly welcome. The
position was, without exception, the muddiest that had
yet fallen to the lot of the Battalion. "To stand still,"
writes a company commander, "was to sink gradually
until the whole of the legs to well above the knees were
immersed and movement was correspondingly difficult."
Lewis guns and rifles had become choked with mud so as
to render the Battalion practically defenceless, but with
much labour they were cleaned, and some rations which
were found in the trench distributed. Dawn broke on a
chilled but yet remarkably cheerful Battalion. The continued
strain of heavy shell fire and conditions of physical
misery were, however, beginning to have their effect, and
several men who in earlier actions had given ample proof
of their courage, collapsed. "One man of D Company who
had previously shown himself one of the stoutest-hearted,
lost his mental balance and suddenly became possessed
of the idea of killing all the Germans in the German Army,
and had to be forcibly restrained from mounting the
parapet. 2/Lieut. Barkworth, who came up from Battalion
Headquarters, succeeded by sheer strength of personality
in restraining him and getting him back to H.Q."</p>

<p>The 19th September was a day of comparative quiet on
the battle front, though shelling and sniping continued in
a desultory fashion. Rain fell steadily and the condition
of the trenches, appallingly bad to start with, became so
wretched as to defy description.</p>

<p>During the night of the 19th a large working party of
the 5th Cheshire Pioneers, under the supervision of the
Brigade Major (Capt. R. E. Neame, V.C., D.S.O., R.E.),
and covered by a screen of one and a half companies of
the Scottish, dug a new trench 800 yards long. This new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
work, Gropi Trench, ran forward from Beef Trench towards
the German line, parallel to the west edge of Bouleaux
Wood, as far as the Morval tram-line. The task was
successfully completed before dawn, but with the advent
of daylight and the consequent exposure of the newly
turned-up earth, the whole brigade area was again subjected
to a heavy bombardment by the enemy's artillery.
The German snipers again became particularly active, and
every rash movement was promptly punished. Under
this gruelling there was nothing for the Battalion to do
but to keep quietly in its trenches and make the best of
an unpleasant state of affairs. That night the Kensingtons
came forward from Angle Wood Valley and took over the
support line from the Battalion, and also Bully Trench in
front of it. The relief was completed by 9.30 p.m., and
never was relief more welcome. The Rangers at the same
time took over the Beef and Gropi system from the London
Scottish. On withdrawal from the trenches the Battalion
moved by companies to bivouacs at Falfemont Farm,
arriving there at 10.45 p.m.</p>

<p>No further movement was made during the 21st and
22nd September, and these two days were fairly quiet as
the principal target for the German guns was provided by
the numerous British batteries in Angle Wood Valley,
which received heavy punishment.</p>

<p>Between the 20th September and the 2nd October the
following reinforcements joined:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Capt. R. N. Keen, Lieuts. W. H. Vernon and A. Bath, 2/Lieuts.
C. A. Speyer, C. Potter, W. R. Gifford, H. W. Spiers, L. C.
Haycraft, L. J. R. Atterbury, C. P. Russell, T. R. Fletcher
and S. A. G. Richardson.</p>

<p>2/Lieut. T. Siddall (25th Londons).</p>

<p>100 N.C.O.'s and men.</p>

<p>A few days after joining Lieut. A. Bath and 2/Lieut. C. P.
Russell were evacuated, the former with a broken ankle,
the latter sick.</p></div>

<p>The men of this draft represented so far as the 1/4th
Battalion was concerned the firstfruits of the "Derby"
scheme, and it must always be a matter for regret that
the dreadful losses already incurred by the Battalion made
it inevitable to pitchfork this fine material straight into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the inferno of the Somme without any opportunity for it
to become previously assimilated into the ranks of the
Battalion. The Somme battles were a severe ordeal even
to the most veteran soldiers; and the bearing of these
young and inexperienced troops in the trials of the latter
half of the Battalion's Somme fighting stands to their
lasting credit.</p>

<p>As we have already remarked, the Cockney soldier,
however wretched his conditions, is never so depressed by
his surroundings as to be unable to find humour in the
situation of the hour. The Battalion had now spent seven
consecutive days in the desolation of the battle area
practically without shelter from the pitiless torrents of
rain which combined with the German shells to churn the
whole surface of the ground into a disgusting glutinous
mass; the troops were soaked to the skin and plastered
with mud from head to foot; but the unconquerable
spirit of cheerfulness held them together, dirty and
dishevelled as they were, a well-knit and disciplined
fighting unit. The condition of the ground, which added
so vastly to the labours of the troops, is illustrated by a
story told by an officer who was present:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A man attempted to cross the valley and started to
plough his way through the mud, but rashly omitted
to lace up his boots, which he had previously removed.
His negligence was quickly visited upon him, for scarcely
had he begun his journey when the mud claimed one
of his boots, which became stuck fast. His powers of
balance were unequal to the task of putting his foot back
in the boot, and he toppled over, both his hands becoming
firmly embedded. His efforts to regain a standing
position were prolonged and violent, but after a time
successful, and finally, boots in hand, he proceeded on his
way amid the cheers of the onlookers, who accepted his
performance as being arranged for their especial amusement,
and were particularly interested in the man's lurid
observations on the subject of boots, mud and war
generally.</p></div>

<p>There were a few occasions, however, when circumstances
seemed too strong even for the 1/4th Londons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
and one of them occurred that night when the rum jars
which arrived with the rations were found, alas, to contain&mdash;lime
juice!</p>

<p>On the evening of the 22nd September the 168th
Brigade was relieved in the left subsector by the 167th
and the Battalion moved back to the comparative peace
of Casement Trench, where it occupied bivouacs until the
afternoon of the 24th, making preparations for the next
bout in the battle line.</p>


<h3><em>The Battle of Morval, 25th September</em></h3>

<p>The continuance of the offensive had been arranged
for the 21st, but the weather conditions placed such a
handicap on the chances of success that it was postponed,
first until the 23rd and again till the 25th September, when
once more the battle broke out on a front from the British
right at Combles to a point half-way between Flers and
Martinpuich. The French were to co-operate in this
attack on the right of Combles ravine. The objectives of
the XIV Corps included the villages of Lesbœufs and
Morval, and, as on the occasion of their earlier attempt on
the 15th, the 56th Division was to form a defensive flank
facing south-east over Combles.</p>

<p>A series of local bombing operations was conducted on
the 24th by the 169th Brigade on the extreme right in
conjunction with the French, which gave them an increased
hold on Combles Trench immediately in front of
the village, and appreciably improved their jumping-off
positions for the following day. During the night also
the two tanks allotted to the Division moved forward to
their rendezvous in the quarry west of Leuze Wood.</p>

<p>For the battle of the 25th the three Brigades of the
Division were all in line, the 169th on the right, with the
167th in the centre and the 168th on the left. The 1/4th
Londons were the right assaulting Battalion of the 168th,
their duty being to clear the northern end of Bouleaux
Wood and to establish a line of posts overlooking the
ravine, while the London Scottish on the left continued
the defensive flank in the direction of Morval (see
Map No. 6).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>At 4.30 p.m. on the 24th the Battalion marched from
Casement Trench to occupy positions of assembly, relieving
the 7th Middlesex in the Gropi-Ranger system
as follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent8">

<p>C Company&mdash;Left front, in Ranger Trench.</p>

<p>B Company&mdash;Right front, in Gropi Trench, and the small communication
trench leading forward to Ranger
Trench.</p>

<p>D Company&mdash;Support, in Gropi Trench.</p>

<p>A Company&mdash;Reserve, in the southern part of Gropi Trench and
Middle Copse.</p></div>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Battalion Headquarters were established in a dugout west of the
north part of Gropi Trench and the Aid Post in the quarry
west of Leuze Wood.</p></div>

<p>The evening of relief was fortunately fairly quiet, but
owing to the complete obliteration of all landmarks some
difficulty was experienced by the guides provided for the
companies in locating the positions to be occupied. However,
Middle Copse was eventually reached, and this point
being gained a little prospecting discovered Gropi Trench,
after which the relief proceeded smoothly and was completed
without unusual incident. Gropi Trench, which
had been dug by the Cheshires, was found to be very well
constructed, and the excellent cover it afforded was the
means of sparing the Battalion a good many casualties
from the enemy snipers, who were active from the direction
of Bouleaux Wood during the morning of the 25th.</p>

<p>After a preliminary bombardment by all available
batteries the British attack opened at 12.35 p.m. on the
25th, but the 168th Brigade's positions being well in
advance of those occupied by the 5th Division on its left,
its attack was deferred until seven minutes later in order to
allow the 5th Division to come up into line. The creeping
barrage, under which the Brigade's advance was made,
was supplied by batteries firing from Angle Wood Valley,
and being thus in enfilade was particularly efficient and
accurate; and under its excellent protection the 1/4th
Londons and the London Scottish advanced steadily at
12.42 p.m.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 424px;">
<img src="images/i_b_204fp.jpg" width="424" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">The Battle of Morval, September 1916</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>The advance of the Battalion was led by C Company
(Grimsdell) in two waves at 50 paces distance, followed by
D Company (Cooper) in similar formation. B Company's
rôle was to conform to the advance and protect the
Brigade's right flank against any possible hostile action
from the southern half of Bouleaux Wood, while A
Company in reserve moved forward to occupy the positions
vacated by the assaulting companies.</p>

<p>The Battalion reached its objectives in the northern
fringe of the Wood with little opposition, and with slight
loss, killing a large number of Germans in the western edge
of the Wood. A great many of the enemy were also put
to flight, and these were caught on the open hillside on
their way to Combles by the Lewis gunners of the Scottish
advancing on our left, who did great execution among
them. The consolidation of the strong posts allotted to
the Battalion at once began, but was considerably interfered
with by German snipers, who were still clinging to
their posts farther south in the Wood. Under their fire
Grimsdell (in charge of C Company) fell, shot through the
head. This harassing fire rendered communication with
Battalion Headquarters a matter of some difficulty, and
continued through the night, as the 167th Brigade on the
right had not been successful in pushing through the
southern extremity of Bouleaux Wood. By nightfall the
new posts were completed and occupied as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<ul>
  <li>Post A&mdash;By 30 men and Lewis gun of C Company.</li>
  <li>Post B1&mdash;By 25 men of D Company.</li>
  <li>Post B2&mdash;By 30 men and 1 Lewis gun of D Company.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>These posts were improved and wired by parties from
the Royal Engineers and the Cheshire Pioneers, while A
Company subsequently constructed an additional post in
the tram-line embankment north of the Wood.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the London Scottish had been equally
successful on our left, and had taken possession of the
German trench running north-east from Bouleaux Wood
in the direction of Morval; and farther still to the north
the Guards Division had captured Lesbœufs, while the
5th Division were hammering at the western outskirts
of Morval.</p>

<p>The positions now occupied by the Brigade were of
immense importance, as they secured excellent observation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
over the northern exits of Combles; and information
received through the French from a German officer prisoner
being to the effect that the Combles garrison was making
preparations to fight its way out north-eastwards, the
further operations of the Brigade were directed towards
working round the north side of Combles and cutting off
its communication with Morval. This scheme naturally
affected the left flank of the Brigade more than the right
flank, on which the Battalion was posted.</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight the 167th Brigade gained a
foothold in Bouleaux Wood on the right of the Battalion,
and a reconnaissance made by Lieut.-Col. Wheatley soon
after dawn on the 26th showed that the Wood was finally
cleared of the enemy. Touch was rapidly gained with the
1st Londons and the line established in front of the east
edge of the Wood.</p>

<p>A few hours later definite information was received
that the enemy had evacuated Combles and that troops
of the 56th Division had entered it and had met in its
deserted streets patrols of the 56th French Division.</p>

<p>The remainder of the day passed quietly for the
Battalion, and a distinct lull occurred in the enemy's shell
fire, while owing to the clearance of Bouleaux Wood
the ground west of it, which had been on the previous
afternoon so much swept by snipers, was now quite
peaceful.</p>

<p>Combles having fallen into our hands the most immediate
need was to improve touch with the French and
carry the united line forward east of the village. Early on
the morning of the 26th Sept. the French captured Frégicourt
and succeeded in establishing themselves in touch
with the 169th Brigade south of Combles, thus securing
the whole of Combles Trench; while on the north of the
village they managed to push patrols forward towards the
sunken road leading to Morval. The road was occupied
by the Rangers who had orders to occupy if possible
the main German third line between Morval and Frégicourt.
This was found still to be strongly held and the
assistance of the Division's two tanks were requisitioned.
Unfortunately both these machines became badly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
"ditched" before reaching their objective, and the
Rangers' attack was therefore abandoned.</p>

<p>That evening the Battalion was relieved in Bouleaux
Wood by the Kensingtons, and withdrew to Bully and
Beef Trenches with feelings of immense elation at having
contributed materially to this striking and solid success.</p>

<p>During the 27th September the trenches held by the
Battalion were heavily shelled, but no attempt was made
by the enemy to launch a counter-attack on the Brigade's
front, and the Germans were evidently content to accept
the loss of Combles as irretrievable. In the evening the
168th Brigade handed over its positions to the 2nd French
Division, and the Battalion, without relief in Bully and
Beef Trenches, withdrew to Casement Trench.</p>

<p>The casualties sustained by the Battalion during this
highly successful operation were remarkably few, amounting
to 2 officers (2/Lieuts. R. E. Grimsdell, killed, and
E. McD. McCormick, wounded), and about 30 N.C.O.'s
and men killed and wounded.</p>

<p>During the evening of relief reports of the full success
of the battle of the 25th September reached the Battalion,
including the splendid news of the fall of the famous series
of German redoubts on the Thiepval Ridge. This welcome
intelligence, combined with the knowledge of the Combles
success, put all ranks into the highest spirits, and created
the pardonable expectation that a "break-through" on a
large scale was imminent. How premature these high
hopes were the Battalion was to learn to its cost on the
7th October.</p>

<p>Mention should be made here of the tasks performed
by R. S. M. Harris during the period the Battalion was
operating in the Leuze Wood and Bouleaux Wood area.
He was responsible for organising all carrying parties
up to advanced Battalion Headquarters with water,
rations and munitions. These duties he carried out in
a highly praiseworthy manner, both he and his small band
of carriers being continually called upon day and night
to tramp up the long Angle Wood Valley, often in the
rain, on practically impassable tracks and more often than
not under shell fire. "As Adjutant," writes Boutall, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
highly appreciated the assistance he gave me in thus
relieving me of a considerable amount of additional work
and anxiety. I do not remember a single instance during
this whole period when he failed us, in spite of the difficult
and heavy tasks we were obliged to impose on him."</p>


<h3><em>The Battle of the Le Transloy Ridges 1st-18th October</em></h3>

<p>Owing to the shortening of the line consequent upon
the fall of Combles, and the extension to their left of
the French, the 56th Division was now withdrawn and
moved out of the battle area, the Battalion marching
at 2 p.m. on the 28th Sept. from Casement to Ville-sur-Ancre,
where rough but welcome billets were occupied.
The Division's rest was destined to be short-lived, for the
following day a warning order was received that it would
take the place in the line of the 6th and Guards Divisions,
which had suffered considerably during a prolonged period
in action.</p>

<p>The Battalion at this stage was unfortunate in
losing Lieut.-Col. Wheatley. The prolonged exposure had
already undermined his health, and at this period he was
recommended a rest by the Medical Authorities. He
refused to go to hospital, and compromised by going to
the Divisional Rest Station, Major H. J. Duncan-Teape
taking command, but so keen was the Colonel to be with
his unit, that without having sufficiently recovered he
returned on October 2nd.</p>

<p>The sector to be occupied was about 2000 yards in
frontage, running in a north-west to south-east direction
through the eastern outskirts of Lesbœufs, and was taken
over on the evening of the 30th September with the
169th Brigade on the right, and the 167th on the left, the
dividing line being the Lesbœufs-Le Transloy Road. The
left subsector (or northern half of the line) lay just below
the crest of the ridge above Lesbœufs, and orders were
issued for the advancement of this part of the line to
positions from which direct observation could be obtained
over the German positions in front of Le Transloy, in
preparation for an early renewal of the offensive.</p>

<p>The 168th Brigade remained in Divisional reserve, and
on the morning of the 30th the Battalion, together with
the London Scottish, moved forward to their former
bivouac area between Trones and Bernafay Woods, the
Kensingtons and Rangers remaining at the Citadel.</p>

<p>The Battalion remained in the Trones Wood area
during the 1st and 2nd October, and a Brigade relief
having been ordered for the following day, moved forward
at 4.30 p.m. to Lesbœufs, relieving the 2nd Londons.
The positions taken over by the Battalion formed the
left subsector of the Brigade front and extended from
the Lesbœufs-Le Transloy Road, which formed the left
boundary, for some 800 yards southwards to the junction
with the London Scottish, who were in line on the right,
the latter battalion being the right flank of the British
Army. The Kensingtons moved into Brigade support in
the old Morval-Flers line, and the Rangers occupied
bivouacs at Ginchy.</p>

<p>The main position taken over by the Battalion was a
roughly constructed trench known as Shamrock, about
50 yards east of the sunken road leading from Lesbœufs
to Morval. In advance of this main position, which was
allotted to A and B Companies, were a number of embryo
trenches in varying stages of construction and quite
isolated from the main line. Of these isolated trenches
the chief was Rainy, which adjoined the Lesbœufs-Le
Transloy Road, about 300 yards ahead of Shamrock, and
Foggy, some distance farther south and separated from
Rainy by a gap of probably 300 yards. C and D Companies
and Battalion Headquarters took up positions in the old
Lesbœufs-Gueudecourt line west of the village.</p>

<p>The resumption of the offensive was imminent; and
it was indeed first fixed for the 5th October, though subsequently
postponed till the 7th owing to the continuance
of adverse weather conditions.</p>

<p>A great deal of constructional work was immediately
necessary in assembly and communication trenches, as
well as in the completion of the necessary advanced dumps
of munitions and stores of all kinds. Working parties
from the Battalion, of the greatest available strength,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
began work on part of these tasks on the night of the 4th,
the new trenches to be dug comprising communications
to join Rainy with Shamrock and with a small advanced
position on the crest of the ridge overlooking Le Transloy.
In addition the road at Rainy was barricaded. Large
working parties were also provided by the Kensingtons
to provide an advanced assembly position for the attack
by connecting Rainy and Foggy, and by the Cheshire
Pioneers and the R.E.'s on other tasks. This latter task,
however, could not be completed in one night and was
continued the following evening. The shocking state of
the ground prevented it from ever being finished, and on
the day of the attack only about 150 yards of trench
had been added to Foggy. On the night of the 6/7th
also a fresh assembly trench for the use of the centre
battalion was taped out by the Brigade Major, and dug
by the Kensingtons. This work was called New Trench.</p>

<p>Although the weather once again had embarked on a
dry spell the long continued rains had rendered working
tasks immensely difficult of accomplishment, and the
tenacious character of the mud added incalculably to the
labour of digging and of reaching the site of the work.
The isolation of the various tasks in this appalling swamp,
from which every landmark had been swept out of existence,
and the constant harassing fire of the enemy's
machine-gunners, caused great delays to working parties
in even locating their work, and all these factors together
tended to reduce the work actually carried out far below
expectations.</p>

<p>The Battalion, not being originally detailed for the
assault, was relieved in the trenches on the evening of the
5th by the Rangers and moved by companies on relief
to bivouacs between Ginchy and Guillemont, leaving A
and C Companies in line for the completion of their tasks
begun the previous night. The following day, however,
intimation was received of a change of orders, and the
Battalion returned to the trenches that night as the
centre assaulting battalion of the Brigade, its place in
brigade support being taken by the Kensingtons.</p>

<p>So far as the 56th Division was concerned the attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
of the 7th October was for the purpose of advancing the
line some 1400 yards farther down the reverse slope of
the Main Ridge, in order to provide a suitable "jumping-off"
line for a further offensive to be launched later
against the fourth German line in front of Le Transloy,
which guarded the Bapaume-Péronne Road. The advance
was to be made under a creeping barrage, in two stages,
to objectives which were not marked by enemy trenches,
but on the farther of which the Division would dig itself
in. On the Division's right the French line would also
be advanced by the 56th French Division, with whom
touch was to be gained on the Frégicourt-Le Transloy
Road.</p>

<p>The 168th Brigade's assault was entrusted to the
London Scottish (right), 1/4th Londons (centre) and
Rangers (left), the dispositions for attack of the Battalion
being as follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent8">

<p>D Company&mdash;(W. H. Vernon) two platoons in New Trench and two
platoons in 25 Trench; in touch with London
Scottish.</p>

<p>C Company&mdash;(Speyer) in Foggy Extension; in touch with Rangers.</p>

<p>B Company&mdash;(Gifford) in Shamrock.</p>

<p>A Company&mdash;(Keen) in support in the sunken road.</p></div>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Battalion Headquarters (Col. Wheatley) were in dugouts south-west
of Lesbœufs, and an advanced report centre (Major
Duncan-Teape) was established in the southern outskirts of
the village.</p></div>

<p>The plan of attack was for D, C and B Companies to
advance at two minutes after zero to the first objective,
the two platoons of D in New Trench being especially
detailed to the task of "mopping up" some German gun
pits some 150 yards to the front which were believed to
be held by a few enemy snipers. At the same time
A Company was to occupy Foggy Extension. After about
fifteen minutes' pause on the first objective, the assault
on the second objective would be pursued by C and B
Companies only.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to the difficulty
experienced prior to the attack by working parties
in locating their tasks, and similar difficulty was met
with by all troops throughout the operations. The con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>sistently
bad atmospheric conditions had rendered aerial
photography almost impossible, and all through the
action the doubt which existed in the minds of commanders
as to the exact position of trenches, our own as well as
the enemy's, was a fruitful source of confusion and loss.
The assembly of the companies for attack was indeed only
accomplished after serious delay owing to the extraordinary
but largely justifiable bewilderment of the guides
detailed to the Battalion. C Company only reached its
position just before dawn after having been led several
hundred yards out of its way, to find on arrival that its
assembly trench was only knee deep and already filled
with wounded. Add to these obstacles to success, the
fact that, owing to the previous terrible losses in commissioned
ranks, it was impossible to avoid sending into
the battle as many as nine officers who had not been
previously in action with the Battalion at all, having
only a few days earlier arrived from England, and it will
be appreciated that the probabilities of success were not
great. Zero was fixed for 1.45 p.m., and at that hour the
barrage dropped. Two minutes later the Battalion rose
out of its trenches and made a gallant attempt to advance.
The story of the remainder of the day is a pitiful tragedy.</p>

<p>The gun pits which had been allotted to the two
platoons of D Company in New Trench were found to be
alive with bravely-manned machine-guns, and under their
withering fire D Company simply melted out of existence.
C Company, following slightly to its right, was able to
avoid total extinction by taking cover in shell holes in
dead ground close by, but 2/Lieut. C. M. Taylor fell under
this fire at the head of the leading wave of the Company.
B Company, following on from Shamrock, met the full
blast of the enemy counter-barrage, and suffered heavy
losses, but pushed bravely on and eventually filtered into
the same general line as was already held by C Company
and the remains of D. Under the devastating fire from
the gun pits further advance was impossible, and the
troops continued to suffer loss where they lay. The afternoon
wore on and the Battalion remained clinging to its
position, about 50 yards from its starting-point, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
after dark. Sergt. H. F. Page of D Company displayed
magnificent coolness, and from his shell hole passed a busy
afternoon picking off the German gunners in the pits
with great deliberation. He was subsequently commissioned
to the King's Own Regiment (Royal Lancaster).
All ranks alike were exposed to the fire and all suffered
proportionately. L. C. Haycraft, a promising young
subaltern of D Company who had already proved his
worth with the bombers of the Civil Service Rifles in
the Hairpin at Hulluch, made an attempt after dark to
ascertain the enemy's position, but he never returned
from his reconnaissance.</p>

<p>Gifford, in charge of B Company, also fell, as did his
platoon commanders, Fletcher and Richardson, the two
last wounded; and C.S.M. James, who received the
Military Medal for his good work, took charge of the
Company and brought it out of action at the end of the day.</p>

<p>On the left the Rangers had met with a similar fate at
the hands of the machine-gunners in Dewdrop Trench,
before whose fire they had been stopped dead with ghastly
loss immediately they rose from the assembly trench.</p>

<p>The London Scottish, on the right, gained a little
success, their right flank achieving a maximum advance
of about 400 yards, but their left felt the blast of the
deadly guns in the pits, and they were kept out of all
except the southern extremity of Hazy.</p>

<p>At about 8.30 p.m. the enemy delivered a counter-attack
from Hazy and Dewdrop under heavy artillery
support, which had the effect of forcing the Brigade
definitely back to its starting trenches.</p>

<p>In the meantime a company of the Kensingtons had
been brought up to Burnaby with the idea of forcing the
Dewdrop position by outflanking it from the north, but
the Germans being found still strongly in possession of
Spectrum, north of the road, the attack was cancelled.</p>

<p>It having become obvious that the assaulting battalions
were dangerously weakened, immediate reliefs were arranged,
and the Battalion that night handed over its position to
the Queen Victorias, who were attached to the Brigade, and
withdrew to the bivouacs at Trones Wood. Here it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
joined by the London Rifle Brigade. The withdrawal of
the Battalion was supervised by Major Duncan-Teape,
who managed by great efforts to get the whole of the
remnants of the companies back over the Ridge just before
daylight broke. The roll call at Trones Wood was a
gloomy spectacle, for neither the 1/4th Londons nor the
London Scottish could muster more than the strength of
about one company.</p>

<p>The total losses in all ranks sustained by the Battalion
on this unfortunate day amounted to about 300 all ranks,
the casualties among officers being:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Killed&mdash;Lieut. W. H. Vernon, 2/Lieuts. C. M. Taylor, W. H.
Gilford, L. J. R. Atterbury and L. C. Haycraft.</p>

<p>Wounded&mdash;Capt. R. N. Keen and 2/Lieuts. T. R. Fletcher, H. W.
Spiers and S. A. G. Richardson.</p></div>

<p>Of this, the last of the Battalion's actions in the great
Somme battles, but little more need be said. The position
which it had been proposed to carry with three weak
battalions was attempted again the following day with
equal lack of success; and subsequently other Divisions
suffered heavy casualties in the unsuccessful endeavour.
Indeed the position never did fall into our possession until
the enemy deliberately gave it up in his retirement of the
succeeding February on to the Hindenburg line.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Col. L. L. Wheatley, D.S.O., had led the Battalion
through many trying ordeals with the unfailing confidence
of all ranks who had the honour to be under his command;
but as already indicated, the strain of the long-protracted
struggle, especially of the last few days, combined with
continually wet clothes, had proved too much for him,
and he now contracted an acute attack of dysentery and
was evacuated to hospital on the 10th. He never returned
to the Battalion which his compelling personality had
made essentially his own.</p>

<p>On the 11th October the Battalion moved to the
Citadel Camp, the gateway through which thirty-five days
earlier it had entered the inferno of the battle; and
the Division being concentrated here after relief by the
4th Division, it marched the following morning to Ville-sur-Ancre,
moving thence by motor-buses to a rest area<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
north-west of Amiens, billets being provided for it at
St Vaast-en-Chaussée.</p>

<p>Of all the great series of actions of the War the battles
of the Somme in 1916 stand out perhaps in the public
memory as the most heroic, and at the same time the most
appalling, and we cannot leave the subject finally without
a few remarks generally reviewing the Battalion's experiences.
Of the thirty-five days spent in XIV Corps area
only four had been spent in rest bivouacs, and during the
remaining thirty-one the Battalion had taken part in active
operations five times. The losses incurred amounted to
the enormous total of nearly 700 in all ranks, of whom
40 were officers.</p>

<p>It would be unfitting to close our account of the Somme
battles without paying some tribute to the magnificent
work performed throughout by Rear Headquarters under
Major H. J. Duncan-Teape. The administrative ranks of
a battalion in action are invariably worked to the limits
of human endurance, but usually with inadequate recognition
of their importance; for it is no exaggeration
to say that on the efficiency with which they maintain
the stream of supplies, whether of rations or munitions,
to the fighting ranks, depends not merely the success, but
the very existence of the troops in advanced positions.
On the Somme the consistently atrocious weather increased
tenfold the fatigue and strain of the administrative
portion of the Battalion: the mud swamps which
had to be traversed, the severe shell fire which plastered
all back areas, the wretched misery of the whole struggle,
and above all the vast responsibility which rested on them,
all combined to make the work of Rear Headquarters an
enormous strain both mental and physical. But throughout
the battles Major Duncan-Teape was constantly alert
and constantly at advanced Headquarters, ascertaining
exactly what was wanted, and getting it done. In Lieut.
H. B. A. Balls, the Acting Quartermaster, and in R.S.M.
Harris he found able and devoted lieutenants whose cool
handling of all difficulties was invaluable.</p>

<p>The transport sections of all battalions were brigaded
under Capt. L. G. Rix at the Citadel, and the 1/4th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Londons' transport section under Lieut. G. V. Lawrie
worked throughout magnificently and never once failed to
deliver the day's supplies. Those who were present will
fully appreciate what this means. The work for horses
and men was exhausting and incessant; and oftentimes
the limbers returned from the forward area to the transport
lines only just in time to load up once more for the upward
journey. The results that were obtained could only have
been achieved by the whole-hearted devotion of all ranks.</p>

<p>Of the men in the companies on whom day after day
fell the burden of physical discomfort and mental strain
it is impossible to speak adequately. The record of their
achievements speaks, and can be left to speak, for itself.</p>

<p>The decorations awarded for services rendered between
the 1st July and the 7th October were:</p>

<div class="hangindent8">

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

THE 1/4 BATTALION DURING THE WINTER 1916/17</h2>


<p>On arrival at St Vaast-en-Chaussée the 1/4th Londons were
reduced in strength to about 275 all ranks, and although
the morale of the troops was not impaired by their recent
experiences, the Battalion was seriously in need of rest,
reorganisation and reinforcement. A few days of light
training, which occupied the mornings only, with games
in the afternoon, went far towards recreating the troops
physically; but the reorganisation of the Battalion was
necessarily a more lengthy and difficult matter. No
company had more than two officers, and N.C.O.'s were very
few. Lewis gun teams and bombers were newly detailed
to their respective duties and untrained, and the building
up once more of the fine fighting battalion which had
entered the trenches at Hébuterne three and a half months
earlier, added to the proper assimilating of the reinforcements
which were expected from England, presented a
task the completion of which was likely to occupy the
greater part of the winter months.</p>

<p>After Lieut.-Col. Wheatley had succumbed to sickness
the command of the Battalion devolved on Major H. J. T.
Duncan-Teape, who was appointed acting Lieut.-Colonel.</p>

<p>The few days' rest at St Vaast were enlivened by an
entertainment given by the Bow Bells, which had an
excellent effect in cheering up the men.</p>

<p>On the 20th October the Division moved to the Hallencourt
area, where it had originally been formed, the
Battalion arriving in billets at Citerne at about 5.30 p.m.
after a march which, in the reduced physical condition of
the troops, proved to be exceedingly trying. Probably
never has the Battalion been accorded a kindlier welcome
in billets than from the good people of Citerne, who, having
received it in February and sent it out to battle, took a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
quite proprietary interest in the laurels which it brought
back to them.</p>

<p>At St Vaast and Citerne the Battalion was joined by
Capt. F. C. Grimwade, who assumed the duties of second
in command with the acting rank of Major, 2/Lieuts.
C. E. V. Richardson and P. Pyne. Capt. L. G. Rix also
returned to the Battalion from Brigade Transport Officer,
and 2/Lieut. O. D. Garratt was appointed Assistant
Adjutant.</p>

<p>A course of light training was continued for a few days
at Citerne under weather conditions which continued
bright and frosty until the evening of the 24th October,
when the Battalion marched at 8 p.m. in a veritable
deluge to Longpré Station to entrain for a fresh area.
The pitiless rain drenched all to the skin, but the men's
spirits remained completely undamped, for the rumour
had gone forth that the new area was far from the Somme,
among the marshes of Flanders. The move from Longpré
was made by tactical train shortly after midnight, and
about midday on the 25th the Battalion detrained at
Merville, whence it marched straight to billets between
Neuf Berquin and Estaires, being now attached to the
XI Corps (Haking) of the First Army (Horne).</p>

<p>No prolonged rest was, however, in store, for although
the Battalions of the 56th Division were momentarily not
prepared for active operations, they were perfectly capable
of holding trenches. No surprise, therefore, was caused
by the receipt the day following arrival at Neuf Berquin
of orders to relieve the 61st Division in the Neuve Chapelle-Fauquissart
area.</p>

<p>A preliminary reconnaissance of the trenches by officers
of Battalion Headquarters and company commanders took
place on the 26th, and on the 27th the 1/4th Londons and
London Scottish moved forward and took over reserve
billets in Laventie from the 2/7th and 2/8th Royal
Warwickshires.</p>

<p>On the 28th October the 168th Brigade completed the
relief of the 182nd Brigade, the 1/4th Londons and Scottish
moving into the right and left subsections respectively
of the Fauquissart sector, there relieving the 2/6th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
and 2/5th Royal Warwickshires, while the reserve billets in
Laventie were taken over by the Kensingtons and Rangers.</p>

<p>The new Divisional frontage covered some 7000 yards
from the neighbourhood of Richebourg l'Avoué on the
right to a point opposite Rouges Bancs on the left, all the
Brigades being in line and each finding its own supports
and local reserves. The 168th Brigade held the extreme
left of the Divisional front, the 169th being on its right,
while the New Zealand Division was on its left. This
extreme deployment of a numerically weak Division was
justified by the quiet character of this area, and the fact
that the German divisions opposed to it were equally with
ourselves somewhat exhausted by recent efforts in the
Somme battles and not anxious to venture on active
operations. To such an extent indeed had our continued
pressure in the south drained the enemy's resources that
his lines opposite the 56th Division were but feebly held,
and at the moment not capable of being strongly reinforced;
and this area was therefore eminently suited
to the recuperation of a battle-worn Division and to the
training in active service conditions of the young troops
from home who were shortly to join it.</p>

<p>The Fauquissart breastworks were in every way similar
to those in the Neuve Chapelle area already described in
connection with the Battalion's service in the Indian
Corps, though being opposite the village of Aubers,
which is on the highest part of the Ridge, were even
more seriously subject to observation from the enemy
lines than the Richebourg breastworks.</p>

<p>The village of Fauquissart, at this period in a condition
of total ruin, consisted of a scattered collection of houses
extending for about half a mile along each side of the Rue
Tilleloy, which ran parallel with the British front breastworks
and about 200 yards in rear of them. A thousand
yards in rear of the Rue Tilleloy, and parallel to it, was
the Rue Bacquerot, these two roads forming good lateral
communication within the sector, though the former could
only be used under cover of darkness. The sector was
also served by three communication trenches starting
from the Bacquerot, Elgin Street, Masselot Street and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
the Strand, the last named during the winter months
usually consisting of a chain of unfordable lakes.</p>

<p>This sector was held by the Battalion with three
companies in line and one in reserve, the reserve company
holding three keeps on the line of the Rue Bacquerot,
called Road Bend, Wangerie and Masselot Posts. Battalion
Headquarters was accommodated in shelters near Temple
Bar on the Rue Bacquerot.</p>

<p>The German lines opposite were heavily wired, and
included two strongly marked salients, the Devil's Jump
and the Wick. But although the enemy had the advantage
in observation owing to his possession of the
Ridge, his front trenches were far from comfortable owing
to the presence behind his lines of the Rivière des Laies
which, as the winter wore on, became more and more
swollen, finally bursting its banks and rendering his
forward defences completely untenable.</p>

<p>Our wire entanglements were exceedingly poor, and
immediate attention was directed to the improvement
of this important part of our defences; the parapets also
were thin, firebays sadly in need of revetment, and the
whole sector seriously lacking in shelter for the men. No
time was lost in evolving an extensive works programme,
which was promptly put into execution, the more important
work being carried out under Royal Engineer
supervision. The urgency of the Brigade works programme
rendered the supply of large working parties
necessary, and it was therefore arranged that of the two
battalions for the time being in Laventie one would act
as "Works Battalion" finding all working parties, while
the other would devote itself to training.</p>

<p>The most peculiar feature of this sector lay in the
immunity from shell fire of Laventie behind the British
lines and of Aubers in the German territory. Each village
layabout 2000 yards in rear of the respective front trenches,
and both were used as reserve billets for the troops holding
the line. By mutual and tacit consent the artillery on
each side refrained from bombarding the other's billets;
any infringement of this unwritten law on one side being
met with immediate and severe retaliation by the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
During the period therefore spent in the Laventie area,
the Battalion on coming out of the line had the enjoyment
of occupying tolerably wind-and water-tight billets without
molestation, although they were distant little more
than a mile from the enemy lines. A considerable number
of civilians still clung to their battered homes in Laventie,
and it was strange to see French soldiers, whose divisions
were serving in Alsace or the Argonne, come to Laventie
"on leave from the front"!</p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons now settled down to a regular
routine of four days in the right subsection breastworks
followed by four days in billets in Laventie, tours being
later extended to six days, and as this routine continued
until the middle of December we need not follow it in detail.</p>

<p>The sector had been particularly quiet prior to the
56th Division's arrival, but almost from the day of its
taking over the line conditions began to change. Possibly
a certain undesirable aggressiveness on the part of the
Londoners began to annoy an enemy who, but for interference,
was content to conduct a perfectly peaceful
war; possibly the change was due to the recovery of both
sides from the fatigue and over-strain of the Somme.
Whatever the reason, certain it is that as the winter wore
on the whole Neuve Chapelle-Fauquissart area began to
become much more lively than it had been. On our side
the most vigorous system of patrolling, of daily organised
shoots by guns of all calibres, trench mortars and machine-guns,
and of an intensive course of sniping, quickly gave
us the ascendancy and caused the Germans a pardonable
irritation under which they showed themselves less and
less disposed to take their punishment quietly.</p>

<p>In the line the Battalion was busily occupied with its
share of the works programme and in patrolling in which
the infrequency of encounters with the enemy in No Man's
Land gradually led to the belief that his front breastwork
was not occupied. This was probed further on the last
evening of November when a fighting patrol of twenty
men under 2/Lieut. W. H. Webster (Intelligence Officer)
entered the enemy lines at the Wick Salient and found it
untenanted, in a shocking condition of flood and affording<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
ample evidence that no attempt was being made to repair
the serious damage caused by our artillery fire.</p>

<p>During the third week in November the Battalion's
frontage was extended to the right, involving the occupation
by the right company of an extra 400 yards of breastwork
and an additional supporting post, Erith, and by
the reserve company of a fourth keep on the Bacquerot
line called Lonely Post. This new piece of breastwork was
usually subjected to a good deal of enemy trench mortar
fire, especially about the point at which Erith Street communication
trench joined the front line. This was an
unpleasant spot. Erith Street sunk into a slight depression
so that all traffic using it was plainly visible to
the Germans; and as it came to an abrupt end some
fifteen yards short of the front line an undesirable gap
occurred which had to be traversed with more than
ordinary agility by those whose duty took them that way.
A good deal of extra trench repairing work was imposed
on us in consequence of the enemy's attentions at this
point, and unfortunately some casualties occurred.</p>

<p>The enemy's activity was rather marked on the 26th
November, during the morning of which day over seventy
5·9-inch shells fell near the Convent observation post
but without a direct hit being obtained. The Convent,
together with two or three other posts along the line of
the Rue Tilleloy, used by the forward observation officers
of our supporting artillery, consisted of a substantial brick
tower some 25 feet in height, like an attenuated Martello
Tower. These had been erected behind the cover of the
houses of Fauquissart before the village had been destroyed.
But the subsequent demolition of the houses had exposed
the towers, which consequently stood up naked and unashamed
within 200 yards of our front line, and their
presence, possibly combined with his evident inability to
hit them, seemed to be a constant source of annoyance
to the enemy.</p>

<p>All this time the Battalion strength was steadily increasing
with reinforcements from home and with the
return of many who had been wounded on the Somme,
till by Christmas it mustered some 700 all ranks. Officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
reinforcements followed on each other's heels with surprising
rapidity, and the following joined during November:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Captains V. S. Bowater and H. M. Lorden, Lieuts. H. Jones
(appointed Brigade Bombing Officer) and H. J. M. Williams,
2/Lieuts. E. G. Dew, L. W. Wreford, S. P. Stotter, H. W.
Spiers, R. W. Chamberlain and W. A. Froy; 2/Lieuts. H. N.
Williams, L. W. N. Jones, H. D. Rees, Bradley (to 168th
L.T.M. Battery) and A. L. Harper (attached from 4th Royal
Welsh Fusiliers); 2/Lieuts. F. H. Hutchins, A. G. Davis and
L. E. Ballance (attached from 11th Londons); Captain H.
Pentelow and Lieuts. T. Coleman (Works Officer) and H. D.
Beeby (attached from Hunts Cyclist Battalion).</p></div>

<p>Captain Pentelow was unluckily hit and sent to hospital
two days after his arrival.</p>

<p>At the end of November the Rev. R. Palmer, M.C., left
the Battalion to take up the duties of Divisional Chaplain
in the 24th Division, his place being taken a few days
later by Rev. S. F. Leighton Green, who remained with
the Battalion until after the Armistice.</p>

<p>About this period a Divisional Musketry Camp was
formed at Le Sart, near Merville, and 2/Lieuts. Wreford
and Pyne were appointed to it as instructors. 2/Lieut.
E. G. Dew was also appointed Battalion Bombing Officer.</p>

<p>On the 21st December a readjustment of the Battalion
sector was effected, and in the afternoon the sector as
originally taken over from the 182nd Brigade was handed
over to the 1/3rd Londons, and the Battalion marched to
billets at Bout Deville.</p>

<p>After three days occupied in cleaning up and training,
Christmas Day was celebrated as a holiday, and, the
billets being beyond the range of any but heavy guns,
with which the Germans were not well supplied on this
front, the rest of the Battalion was quite undisturbed.
But every effort was made to render the Germans'
Christmas as uncomfortable as possible. At 6.30 p.m. on
Christmas Eve a continuous steady bombardment of his
defences by all available batteries up to 6-inch guns began,
and lasted for forty-eight hours. This action was evidently
much resented by the enemy, and after Christmas the
trench warfare in this area was conducted with greater
fierceness than it had been previously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>The Bow Bells were now established in the theatre at
La Gorgue, and it was found possible to provide a free
visit for every man in the Battalion to its splendid
Christmas pantomime "Aladdin," which was most heartily
appreciated.</p>

<p>During the temporary absence of 2/Lieut. O. D.
Garratt, the duties of Intelligence Officer were taken by
2/Lieut. J. R. K. Paterson (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders,
attached), who remained with the Battalion for
about a month.</p>

<p>On New Year's Day 1917 the 168th Brigade relieved
the 169th Brigade in Moated Grange sector, the Rangers
and Kensingtons occupying the trenches, with the London
Scottish in support, about Rouge Croix and Pont du Hem
on the La Bassée Road, while the 1/4th Londons remained
in Divisional reserve billets at Riez Bailleul.</p>

<p>A week here was spent in supplying working parties,
of which the labour was considerable owing to the long
distance&mdash;about four miles&mdash;which had to be covered
each night in each direction by parties going up the line
for work. The weather, moreover, had taken a marked
change, and a very severe frost had set in which increased
tenfold the labour of digging. Towards the end of the
week snow fell adding further to the fatigue of the long
night marches.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 9th January 1917 the Battalion
took over from the Kensingtons the right subsection of
the Moated Grange sector. This sector had seen a good
many changes both as regards defences and boundaries
since the Battalion's previous occupation of it in the
summer of 1915, and the lines now taken over extended
from Sign Post Lane on the right for a frontage of some
1400 yards to a point opposite the village of Mauquissart
which lay just within the German lines.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_b_224fp.jpg" width="500" height="497" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Laventie, Winter 1916-1917</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>The sector was held with three companies in the front
breastworks and supporting posts and one in reserve on
Cardiff Road. Battalion Headquarters occupied shelters
at Ebenezer Farm. These positions were far from ideal.
The strength of the Battalion was much scattered and
difficult of control in emergency, owing to the exceedingly
bad communications within the area. The supporting
platoons of the front line companies, at Bristol House,
Cornwall Siding and Pump House, occupied the only remaining
tenable portions of what had originally been the
German second line prior to the Battle of Neuve Chapelle,
and were separated from each other by about 100 yards
of broken down and almost impassably wet breastworks.
For communication from front to rear only one trench,
Tilleloy South, was passable with any degree of safety
in daylight. Between Pump House and the front line, a
distance of about 250 yards, it was seriously overlooked
from the German positions in the Bois du Biez, with the
result that traffic up and down it was frequently sniped
with trench mortar and 5·9 shells.</p>

<p>Always an area of considerable activity, the Moated
Grange possessed several unpleasant features as a result
of the active mining operations which had begun in 1915,
and were still proceeding with unabated energy. The
Duck's Bill Farm had given place to an enormous crater
of the same name, linked with the British lines by a
defended sap which left the front line at Sunken Road.
The defence of this crater and sap took a platoon, whose
arduous duties of continual listening and constant preparedness
for an enemy raid were carried out under
exceedingly rough conditions, as both the crater and the
sap were full of water and shelters were conspicuous by
their absence.</p>

<p>On the front occupied by the left company the German
lines were invisible from the British breastworks owing to
the lips thrown up round the Colvin craters, a series of
some thirty or more of immense size which covered half
the area of No Man's Land at this point. The largest of
this series, the Mauquissart crater, occupied the site of
what had once been our front line, and the breastwork
now ran round its nearer lip. This mined area was the
most uncomfortable part of the line, since the Germans
were continually searching with trench mortar fire for the
heads of our mine shafts while the cover afforded to enemy
patrols by the crater lips themselves necessitated constant
vigilance and counter-patrolling activity on the part of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
trench garrison. Add to this the extreme hardship which
the troops in this part of the line inevitably had to undergo
owing to the total lack of dugouts and the perishing cold.
The blowing of so many craters had, moreover, cut off
the ditches between fields which had formerly been used
for draining the trenches, with the result that there was
no means of getting rid of the water which in a large
number of firebays rose higher than the firestep. Under
these conditions cooking in the neighbourhood of the
front line was out of the question, and all cooked food had
to be carried by permanent headquarter carrying parties
from the Battalion cook-house near Ebenezer Farm; in
the case of rations destined for the flank platoons this
meant a trudge for the food carriers of over a mile in each
direction at each meal.</p>

<p>The defences generally had suffered severely both from
the enemy's shell fire and the effects of the alternation
of sharp frost and heavy rain, and an immense amount
of labour was called for in working and carrying parties
for the breastworks as well as for the wire entanglements,
which were in a very weak condition. The single communication
trench, therefore, became frequently congested
with long lines of troops "humping" material and food
to the front line, and altogether the Moated Grange was a
hard sector to run efficiently and a remarkably unpleasant
one to live in.</p>

<p>Two tours of six days each were spent in this sector,
broken by six days&mdash;not of rest, but of most exhausting
working parties&mdash;in Riez Bailleul. The days in line saw
a good deal of shelling and the Battalion suffered some
loss, but in spite of this and of exposure to intense cold
the men were probably more happy in the line than in
billets. Further heavy falls of snow had occurred. The
working parties supplied from Riez Bailleul were largely
engaged in drawing trench stores and material at a dump
on the La Bassée Road between Pont du Hem and Rouge
Croix, itself nearly two miles from billets; and thence
pushing it up to the front trenches on the tram-line dignified
with the title of Great Eastern Railway, a further distance
of upwards of 3000 yards. From railhead this material,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
consisting of trench boards, rolls of barbed wire, revetting
frames, hurdles and other heavy stuff had to be distributed
to companies in the line. These fatigues were obviously
exhausting, and seldom did a party leaving billets at
5.30 p.m. return before midnight.</p>

<p>The most difficult task of all, however, which may not
yet have quite faded from the memories of many, was
connected with an ingenious scheme for draining the
craters with heavy cast-iron water mains each about
16 feet long. With infinite labour these were brought to
tram railhead, but at this point the difficulty of carrying
pipes, each weighing some 200 pounds, along 500 yards of
quagmire proved too much even for the stout hearts of
Cockneys; and the high hopes which the author of the
scheme had entertained of draining the craters vanished
as his pipes sank in the mud. A change from this routine
to the comparative peace of trench mortaring in the line
was not unwelcome.</p>

<p>An act of gallantry occurred during the first tour which
must be recorded. During one of the enemy's midday
bombardments a time-fuzed medium trench mortar shell
fell on the parapet of our breastwork on the lip of Mauquissart
crater, and lodged in the revetting hurdle at the side
of the trench. The firebay happened to be crowded with
men working on the defences, and heavy casualties must
inevitably have been caused but for the bravery of 2/Lieut.
W. H. Webster, who rushed forward and, seizing the shell,
flung it over the parapet into the crater, where it immediately
exploded. For this gallant action 2/Lieut. Webster
was awarded the D.S.O.</p>

<p>The enemy's artillery and trench mortars showed a
marked increase of activity during the second occupation
of Moated Grange, the craters, the Duck's Bill and Pump
House, coming in for most of the punishment. The 23rd
January was perhaps the most trying to the troops.
During the morning "hate" a well-placed minenwerfer
completely cut off the left platoon in the craters, the only
approach to them being by way of an exposed and little
used trench, Min Street, which involved a detour of about
3200 yards from Headquarters. Shortly after midday a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
second lucky German shell lighted on a dump of medium
trench mortar shells which were lying within a few yards
of a shelter occupied by several men of the right company.
A terrific explosion took place and caused a large crater
which cut off the Battalion's right flank also, but, strange
to say, without inflicting so much as a scratch on any of
the men in the vicinity. These incidents are recounted
merely as instances of the constant annoyance caused to
the troops in line by the enemy's harassing tactics, as
every bit of damage caused in this way involved extra
work to the already over-burdened troops in repairing it.</p>

<p>On the last evening in the line, the 25th, an attempt
was made by a fighting patrol of the reserve company (C)
under 2/Lieut. Ballance to obtain an identification from
the enemy. Wire-cutting shoots had taken place for two
days previously in preparation for this, and arrangements
were made to support the patrol with artillery fire as
occasion should arise. The enemy were found, however, to
have made efficient counter-preparations, and the surprise
effect of the patrol having failed, the project had to be
abandoned with the loss of 1 man killed and 2 wounded.</p>

<p>During this tour the Battalion sustained 1 officer
casualty, 2/Lieut. W. Quennell, wounded.</p>

<p>On the 26th January the Battalion was relieved by the
1/8th Middlesex at 10.5 p.m. and withdrew to rest billets
at La Gorgue, the 168th Brigade having passed into
Divisional reserve with Brigade Headquarters at Merville.</p>

<p>The 168th Brigade in rest in the Merville area settled
down to such training as was possible, the ground being
covered with snow. One or two useful instructional
schemes with contact aeroplanes were carried out, but the
weather conditions prevented serious outdoor work, and
the training hours were, for the most part, devoted to
repolishing the parade discipline of the Brigade. According
to the usual custom of the Battalion when opportunity
offered itself, the drums beat Retreat daily and the
Regimental Quarter Guard and inlying picket mounted in
the Grande Place at La Gorgue.</p>

<p>Two further drafts of about 70 N.C.O.'s and men
joined the Battalion in January.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>It had been the intention that the 168th Brigade should
pass fourteen days in rest, but this idea had to be unexpectedly
abandoned owing to a concentration of troops
near the frozen inundations of the Yser, where it was
feared that a sudden German advance over the ice might
have somewhat disturbing effects on the Allies' positions.
This caused the services of the 168th Brigade to be requisitioned
once more, and on the 1st and 2nd February
it relieved the 111th Brigade of the 37th Division in the
Neuve Chapelle sector, the Rangers and Kensingtons
occupying the line, while the Scottish moved as Works
Battalion to billets at Croix Barbée and the 1/4th Londons
as Training Battalion to Fosse.</p>

<p>On the 1st February 2/Lieut. C. E. V. Richardson was
admitted to hospital.</p>

<p>After training at Fosse for six days the 1/4th Londons
took over from the Kensingtons the right subsector of
Neuve Chapelle sector on the 8th February.</p>

<p>The Battalion now found itself after a lapse of over a
year once more in the area in which it had passed so many
months with the Ferozepore Brigade. The sector taken
over comprised the old Rue du Bois (right, centre and left)
sections, and extended from a point opposite the German
Boar's Head Salient on the right to some 250 yards north
of the La Bassée Road on the left. Considerable changes
had now taken place in the method of holding the line;
old well-known trenches had fallen into disuse and fresh
ones had taken their places. Those who looked for the
Crescent, Orchard Redoubt, and other well-remembered
spots found them broken down and no longer occupied.
The front line breastwork was now occupied in isolated
posts at intervals of about 150 yards, each garrisoned by
a platoon. Each post was protected on its flanks as well
as in front by wire entanglements, while the intervening
firebays had been either filled in or choked with barbed wire.</p>

<p>The communications within the sector were tolerably
good, but the breastwork was thin and in many places low,
a natural result of leaving long portions of it unoccupied
for several months.</p>

<p>The main line of resistance was now in the reserve or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
"B" line which, on the right of the sector, was represented
by Guards Trench in front of the Rue du Bois, and on the
left by the old British front line (as it had been before the
Battle of March 1915) in Edgware Road. Battalion
Headquarters in 1915 had occupied dugouts on the Rue
du Bois, but were now at Lansdowne Post, which formerly
had housed a whole battalion. The defence scheme provided
for holding the "B" line at all costs in the event of
serious attack, so that the front line became virtually a
line of outposts. This method of holding the line in
great depth was not only far sounder than the former
method of crowding the whole strength into the front
trench, but was also more economical, as the sector which
formerly had demanded a garrison of a whole brigade
was held by one battalion.</p>

<p>The line was held with two companies in the front line
posts and two in support in the "B" line.</p>

<p>On the right of the La Bassée Road the German trenches
were about 100 yards distant, and it was soon found that
the enemy snipers had been allowed to gain the ascendancy
over the British, a state of affairs which all battalions of
the Brigade promptly set to work to correct.</p>

<p>The first day's occupation of this sector passed without
incident, but on the evening of the 9th February, at about
7 p.m., the enemy opened a heavy trench mortar and
machine-gun bombardment on the front line from Pioneer
to Pope Posts, astride the La Bassée Road. The trench
mortar fire was well directed, and the breastwork on the
right of Pope Post was badly breached. At about 7.30 p.m.
this preparatory shelling was followed by a heavy "box"
barrage, and an enemy raiding party entered our lines
between Pioneer and Pope Posts. An S.O.S. signal was
sent up from the left company Headquarters, and our
artillery responded promptly with a heavy barrage on the
German front line and communication trenches.</p>

<p>The raiders, about twelve in number, divided into two
groups, of which one attacked Pope Post and the other
Pioneer Post. The attack on Pope Post was driven off by
the garrison, three of the raiding party being bayoneted
by Sergt. Gardiner, whereupon the others turned and fled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
being followed back to the German lines by the second
group.</p>

<p>Capt. Rix, commanding B Company, accompanied
by his Sergt.-Major (Shelton) and his runner, gallantly
endeavoured to pass through the barrage on Hun Street
in order to take control of affairs in the front line; but all
were unfortunately hit by the same shell, Shelton and the
runner being killed outright while Rix died in hospital a
few days later. The raiders were successful in capturing
2/Lieut. Webster, D.S.O., who was with the Lewis gun
post at Pioneer Post; he is believed to have been mortally
hit prior to his capture, and died in the enemy's hands
the following day. In addition to these regrettable
casualties about a dozen men were slightly wounded, the
bulk of the loss on our side being sustained by a carrying
party from the Rangers who were caught by the German
barrage at Edgware Road tram railhead. 2/Lieut. Stotter
(B Company) was also slightly wounded. He remained at
duty for some days, but was admitted to hospital about ten
days later. The reorganisation of the line was promptly
taken in hand by Capt. Stanbridge (A Company) in support,
who temporarily reinforced the front line with one of his
platoons under 2/Lieut. Harper, and subsequently took
over B Company vice Rix. The raiding party belonged,
as was found from the three enemy dead left in our hands,
to the 2nd Battalion, 13th Bavarian Regiment. For his
coolness and good work during the raid Sergt. Gardiner
was awarded the Military Medal.</p>

<p>The remainder of the night passed without incident,
and the bright moonlight during the later hours enabled
our working parties to make considerable headway in
repairing the breaches in our breastwork.</p>

<p>On the morning of the following day an observed shoot&mdash;which
caused very great material damage&mdash;was carried
out by our trench mortar batteries on the enemy first and
second lines. This shoot produced a certain amount of
trench mortar retaliation on Guards Trench, in the course
of which an unlucky shell destroyed a Stokes mortar
section under 2/Lieut. Bradley, and the whole of its team,
causing a block in our line at Mole Post.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>No further incident of importance occurred during the
remainder of this tour, though our lines were daily subjected
to heavy bombardments by the enemy medium
trench mortars, especially in the neighbourhood of Pioneer
Post, where very considerable damage was caused to our
breastworks and wire. On the evenings of the 12th and
13th, however, when this activity of the enemy began to
assume somewhat serious proportions, they were effectively
silenced by prearranged retaliatory shoots by our supporting
artillery on the German front and support lines.</p>

<p>The following afternoon the Battalion handed over
the right subsection to the Kensingtons, and withdrew as
Works Battalion to billets at Croix Barbée. Here the
Battalion supplied large working parties nightly, the
principal tasks being the raising and thickening of the
weak portions of the breastwork and the wiring of the
new parts of the "B" line.</p>

<p>Throughout this winter the prosecution of the works
programme placed a heavy strain on all ranks and totally
deprived the periods spent out of the line of any semblance
of rest. Even on the night of relief the working parties
were carried out, and many times during these months
companies which had held front line trenches for six days
marched back to reserve billets and within an hour were
paraded again for a working party from which they were
not dismissed till after midnight. The necessity for this
extreme pressure of work was doubtless real, but the
unceasing drudgery of it could not be conducive to good
work while the efficient recreation of the men by games
out of the line received so little attention.</p>

<p>However, on this occasion it was found possible to
make progress with the Brigade boxing competition, a
good ring being available at the Brigade Lewis Gun School
at Croix Barbée, and in this competition the Battalion
gained several successes.</p>

<p>On the 20th February the Battalion returned to the
trenches, taking over the right subsection from the
Kensingtons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>This tour of duty was marked by an all round increase
of activity both in trench mortar and artillery fire on both
sides, the points which received the majority of the shelling
being the front line about the much battered Pope and
Pioneer Posts, Port Arthur and the "B" line in the
neighbourhood of the Rue du Bois. The enemy was also
active by day with rifle grenades, and at night with
machine-gun fire.</p>

<p>Owing to the particular discomfort of living in Pope
and Pioneer Posts an inter-company relief between the
two left companies was effected on the 23rd February,
A Company withdrawing into support in favour of C
Company, which took over Port Arthur sector.</p>

<p>An attempt was made on the evening of the 26th by
the 5th Division on the right to raid in force the enemy's
lines to the south of the Boar's Head Salient. The enemy
had exhibited numerous signs of nervousness, and it was
not altogether surprising to find him quite prepared for
the attempt by the 5th Division. The exact point against
which the raiding party was directed, however, did not
coincide with his anticipations, for the bulk of his rather
sharp counter-barrage came down on the sector held by
this Battalion. This barrage lasted with intensity for
twenty minutes, and, trench mortars being freely employed,
caused a good deal of further damage to our
already weak breastworks, but inflicted practically no
loss of personnel.</p>

<p>The following morning the Kensingtons once more relieved
the 1/4th Londons, taking over the right subsection
and extending it to the left as far as the outskirts of Neuve
Chapelle village, the adjusted line being known as the left
subsection of Ferme du Bois sector.</p>

<p>On relief the Battalion occupied billets as training
battalion at Fosse, C Company being detached in hutments
at Les Huit Maisons. Training was proceeded
with uninterruptedly though the weather remained intensely
cold and further falls of snow occurred. The
opportunity was taken to hold a Battalion cross-country
run, which passed off as satisfactorily as the arctic conditions
permitted. The frost, which had lasted for several
weeks, was indeed now becoming a little serious as it was
utterly impossible, owing to the hardness of the soil, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
carry out repairs to the trenches which were daily being
more knocked about by the enemy's fire. The appalling
destruction which must later be caused by the inevitable
thaw filled the hearts of those who would form part of
the subsequent working parties with feelings of misgiving,
mingled with resentment.</p>

<p>On the 5th March the Battalion relieved the
Kensingtons in the left subsection of Ferme du Bois,
the order of battle in the front line being from the right,
B, D and A Companies, with C in support in the "B"
line. The additional frontage between La Bassée Road
and Neuve Chapelle was also held in isolated posts.</p>

<p>As before the "B" line was the main line of resistance;
but the great length of the "B" line sector&mdash;some
2300 yards&mdash;which had to be held in eight separate posts,
with three additional posts at night, presented a difficult
problem in defence to one weak company of about 120
fighting ranks. The solution of the problem was not,
however, actually called for as the enemy remained unusually
quiet for the whole of this tour of duty, during
which the snow fell thicker every day. After an
occupation of four uninteresting days the Battalion was
relieved in the left subsection on the afternoon of the
9th March by 1/6th Duke of Wellington's Regiment (49th
Division). On relief it withdrew to billets at Bout Deville,
marching the following morning at 8 a.m. to Merville,
where the Brigade entrained for the Le Cauroy area.
Detrainment took place at Doullens, and the Battalion
marched some six miles to billets at Le Souich, arriving
shortly before midnight.</p>

<p>The Battalion, which had left the Somme battlefields
in an exhausted condition in the previous October, had
undergone a good schooling in the Flanders breastworks.
The strength had been increased to some 850 all ranks,
and all new drafts had become not only well assimilated,
but also well trained in a rather trying trench warfare.
The physical strain on the troops throughout the winter
had been exceptionally severe, owing to the terrible intensity
of the winter weather, and the very great amount
of trench work for which the Battalion had been called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
upon; and of this side of the incidents of the winter
sufficient has already been said for it to be realised
without difficulty that, although the Battalion still had
a clean bill of health, the prospect of a rest before
embarking on active operations was welcomed by all.</p>

<p>The great retirement of the Germans was now in
progress, and as the 1/4th Battalion was not actively concerned
in this we may turn for the moment to follow the
fortunes of the 2/4th Battalion, who had recently arrived
in France with the 58th Division and were now in action
in the Arras sector.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

THE 2/4TH BATTALION IN FRANCE--GERMAN RETIREMENT
FROM THE SOMME</h2>


<p>The 58th Division, of which the 2/4th Londons formed a
part, after remaining at Ipswich for about a month, was
transferred to the Southern Command in hutted camps
at Sutton Veny, near Warminster, on the 10th July 1916.</p>

<p>Here the Division, being concentrated in an area which
provided excellent training facilities, had a chance to
become thoroughly welded together and to show the
material of which it was made in a manner which had
hitherto been impossible, for the influence of scattered
billets is invariably and inevitably unfavourable to strict
discipline. The fullest advantage was taken of this golden
opportunity, and the resultant tightening of discipline and
advancement of all ranks in technical efficiency rapidly
justified the change of station. A very great amount
of work still lay before the whole Division before it
would be fit to take its place in the line overseas, and
much reorganisation in various directions was effected
with entirely beneficial results soon after its arrival at
Warminster.</p>

<p>Amidst all this work, which was carried out at fever-heat,
the amusement of the men was not overlooked. An
excellent Divisional band was formed, and their good
services were added to early in December by the creation
of a Divisional concert troop "The Goods." Not to be
left behind in these achievements the 2/4th Londons
formed their own concert party, called for some not too
obvious reason "The Tanks," which afforded excellent
entertainments under the able direction of 2/Lieuts.
T. J. Bell and C. J. Graham, who were assisted by Pipe-Major
Ling, Corpl. Wilkinson, L./Corpls. Smith, Ringrose
and Hardy, and Pte. Rosenbloom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>The 2/4th Londons had already attained a position
which is believed to be unique in the annals of the British
Army inasmuch as they, a Battalion affiliated to an
English line regiment, had become the possessors of a
pipe band. This band had originally been formed for
recruiting purposes, but with the initiation of the "Derby
Scheme" its services were no longer necessary for the
enticement of recruits, and it had been secured for the
Battalion. The pipers wore the Glengarry cap and the
Royal Stuart tartan. They were without doubt an exceedingly
good band and lightened many a weary mile
of road both in England and France with their stirring
music.</p>

<p>An attempt, which originated in the 2/4th Londons,
was also made to produce a Divisional magazine, and this
appeared in September under the title of <cite>The Direct
Hit</cite>. It was well received and attained the age of three
months, but was then discontinued.</p>

<p>Shortly after arrival at Sutton Veny the Division came
under the command of Major-Gen. H. D. Fanshawe, C.B.,
who ultimately took it to France where he remained in
command for some months.</p>

<p>Various changes took place in the 2/4th Londons, and
in November 1916 command of the Battalion was assumed
by Lieut.-Col. W. R. H. Dann (Bedfordshire Regiment),
Capt. W. A. Nunneley becoming second in command with
the temporary rank of Major. The personnel was also
strengthened by the arrival of a large officer reinforcement
from the 4th (Reserve) Battalion, the majority of whom
had already seen service in France in the ranks of various
London Battalions.</p>

<p>In the latter part of January 1917 the long awaited
order arrived for the 58th Division to proceed overseas.
On the 23rd of that month the 2/4th Battalion left Sutton
Veny with a strength of 32 officers and 976 other
ranks and proceeded to Southampton, where it embarked
on the <em>Viper</em>, and crossed to Havre, arriving
the following morning at daybreak. Disembarkation
took place at once and the Battalion, preceded by its
pipe band, marched to the Reinforcement Camp at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Sanvic. The following officers accompanied the Battalion

<p>The next day the Battalion entrained for Abbeville,
but on arrival found its orders to stay there countermanded
and the journey was therefore continued to
Fortel, a small village about six miles south-west of
Frevent.</p>

<p>The unusually hard frost which was general throughout
northern France in the winter of 1916/17 still held the
country in its grip, and the conditions for a raw battalion
even in billets were far from comfortable, but a ten days'
stay at Fortel, which was devoted to training and generally
acclimatising the Battalion to its new surroundings,
prepared it at least in a small degree for the rigours of a
winter campaign.</p>

<p>By the 5th February the concentration of the 58th
Division was complete, and the 173rd Brigade under
Brig.-Gen. Hurst began to move by easy stages to the line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
the 2/4th Londons lying at Le Souich on the 6th, and at
Sus-St Leger on the 7th and 8th.</p>

<p>The following day the Brigade moved forward and
became attached to the 146th Brigade of the West Riding
(Territorial) Division, for instruction in trench warfare,
the 2/4th Londons being divided up between the battalions
of the 146th Brigade for this purpose, with two companies
in reserve at Bailleulmont and Humbercamp. The 146th
Brigade was at this time holding a sector south-west of
Arras facing Ransart. Ransart lies at the base of a small
spur between two watercourses, both of which are usually
dry, and the German trenches in front of the village were
dominated at an average distance of about 600 yards by
our own on the western side of the valley.</p>

<p>This part of the front had the reputation of being
exceedingly quiet (and therefore suitable for the first tour
of duty of inexperienced troops), and was the defensive
position taken up by the French in October 1914 when,
after the Battle of the Aisne, the battle front had become
stabilised by the continued extension of the flanks of the
opposing forces until they reached the sea. The British
Army had taken over the area from the French in July 1915.</p>

<p>After five uneventful days in this sector the Battalion
was relieved on the 14th by the 2/12th Londons, and
having rendezvoused at La Cauchie, about three miles in
rear of the line, embussed to Sus-St Leger where it went
into billets for a week's rest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The important changes which were to take place in
this area during the next six weeks are so material to the
development of the Campaign of 1917 that it is necessary
to review briefly the operations which were being conducted
further south. The termination of the battles of the
Somme in November 1916 had left the enemy in possession
of the whole of the Ancre Valley from Le Transloy to
Grandcourt and of excellent positions on the high ground
immediately north of Beaumont-Hamel; while in rear of
this position he had made great progress in the construction
of two more lines of defence running in a direction from
north-west to south-east about Bapaume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>The advance of our troops over the Thiepval-Morval
Ridge had, however, left him confined in a marked salient,
of which the apex was Gommecourt Wood, between the
Ancre on the south and the Scarpe where it passes Arras
on the north; and conditions appeared very favourable
for improving our situation in the neighbourhood of
Beaumont-Hamel before the conditions of winter should
render active operations on a large scale impossible.
Accordingly operations which met with immediate success
were reopened on the 18th November on the left bank
of the Ancre between Grandcourt and Pys. These were
renewed in January in the Beaucourt valley on the opposite
side of the river with such marked success that the enemy
was compelled to relinquish his hold on the high ground
north of Beaumont-Hamel while his position in Grandcourt
became precarious in the extreme.</p>

<p>On the night of the 5th/6th February 1917 Grandcourt
was evacuated and the enemy fell back to the line
Serre-Miraumont-Pys. Attacks with which these initial
successes were followed up on the 17th and 18th February
secured to the British complete command over the enemy's
defences of the upper Ancre and Miraumont village, while
they accentuated his salient west of Serre. The loss of
this would lay open for us a further advance on Puisieux-au-Mont
and render the defence of the Gommecourt
Salient exceedingly hazardous. It was therefore to be
expected that any further withdrawal on the part of the
enemy from in front of Miraumont would entail a withdrawal
on a large scale, and this actually occurred.</p>

<p>By the 24th February British troops had occupied
Serre and all the enemy's defences on a line from that
village to Gueudecourt, a frontage of some nine miles.
On the 27th February patrols entered Gommecourt park
and village, the prize so desperately fought for and withheld
from the 1/4th Battalion six months earlier, and the
following morning the whole of Puisieux fell into our
hands. On the right the enemy's resistance was more
stubborn, but an assault on Irles on the 10th March,
which proved entirely successful, brought us face to face
with the first of the two lines of defence about Bapaume
to which reference has already been made. But even here
the enemy made no determined stand, and by the 13th
our pursuing columns were making preparations to assault
the rear line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The situation, therefore, when the 2/4th Battalion
returned to the line after its rest, the last two days of
which were spent at Gaudiempré, was that Corps and
Divisional staffs were eagerly seeking information as to
any indication of the enemy's expected retirement between
Arras and Monchy-au-Bois, this being the only sector
between Arras and the Somme now left in his possession,
which he had held at the end of the Somme operations.
This entailed a heavily increased burden of night patrolling
duties on all troops in the line.</p>

<p>On the 24th February the 2/4th Battalion moved into
Bellacourt, relieving the 1/5th K.O.Y.L.I. in Brigade
reserve, taking over the front line from the 1/4th K.O.Y.L.I.
on the following day. The sector lay between Ransart and
Blairville to the left of that previously occupied, and was
held with three companies in front trenches and one in
support. Battalion Headquarters were in Grosville.</p>

<p>The German lines opposite this sector possessed two
features of particular interest in the Blockhouse, a strongly
defended salient, and the Talus, a machine-gun post pushed
some 200 yards forward of their main line in a hillside
embankment. Two sunken roads and a watercourse in
No Man's Land added to the interest of life and provided
our patrols with some useful work.</p>

<p>The advancing British troops in the south this day
were beginning to threaten Puisieux, the possession of
which would lay open to attack the Bucquoy Ridge to its
north. It was clear that with British forces on the
Bucquoy Ridge the German reserve lines of defence and
gun positions about Adinfer Wood (which supported the
lines now opposite the 173rd Brigade) must either retreat
precipitately or run a serious risk of being cut off. Requests
for information from Brigade consequently became
more and more insistent, and information was passed to
the Battalion that the lines opposite had actually been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
evacuated. Officers' patrols under 2/Lieuts. A. G. Croll,
A. M. Duthie, T. J. Bell and D. S. Boorman, which
covered No Man's Land, especially in the vicinity of the
Blockhouse and the Talus on the nights of the 24th and
28th, however, elicited unmistakable signs of occupation
of the German defences. But the desultory nature of the
enemy's machine-gun fire, and of his shell fire from the
direction of Adinfer Wood, the marked decrease in the
number of Véry lights put up by him at night and the
constant sounds of transport moving on the roads in rear
of his lines all provided indications that his retirement
could not long be delayed. The patrols frequently heard
working parties hard at work in rear of the enemy's lines,
and it afterwards transpired that these were busily
engaged in mining the roads over which our advancing
troops must pursue the German retreat.</p>

<p>It had long been known that the enemy was hard at
work on a highly fortified defensive line which left his
front defences at Arras and ran in a south-easterly direction
in front of Cambrai to near St Quentin. This line,
the famous "Hindenburg" line, was roughly parallel to
that now occupied by our advancing troops in the south
and some eight miles distant from it. Reports from
British airmen showed that the Hindenburg line was now
the scene of feverish activity on the part of the enemy,
and this information seemed to confirm the probability
indicated by the results of our patrolling that the relinquishment
of the Monchy-Arras line was imminent.</p>

<p>A most unfortunate incident occurred on the night of
the 28th February, when a strong patrol under 2/Lieut.
R. K. Caparn returning to our lines was fired upon by the
sentries who apparently had failed to grasp the prearranged
signal, with the regrettable result that 2/Lieut.
Caparn was very seriously wounded and L./Corpl. Warren,
Ptes. Anderson and Vickery were killed.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 2nd March the Battalion was
relieved by the 2/2nd Londons and withdrew to Divisional
reserve in billets at Basseux and Bailleulval. Three days'
training ensued, followed by a move on the 6th to
Humbercamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>The 173rd Brigade had now "side-stepped" to the
right, and on the 7th March the 2/4th Londons once more
entered the front line, relieving the 1/6th North Staffords
in a sector known as Z1 immediately opposite Monchy-au-Bois.
Battalion Headquarters opened in Bienvillers-au-Bois.</p>

<p>This sector was about three miles south of that previously
occupied, and similar conditions prevailed both as
regards ground and the German retirement. No Man's
Land, which was here about 300 yards wide, fell gently
from our lines to the village of Monchy-au-Bois, which
had been made a network of defences by the enemy, his
first line passing immediately in front of the village. In
rear of the village the ground again rose gently to the
Adinfer Ridge.</p>

<p>Bienvillers was almost daily given an unpleasantly
copious allowance of gas shells which caused numerous
casualties, principally to carrying parties from Battalion
Headquarters. Among these was Major Nunneley, who
was gassed on the 10th; his duties of second in command
were assumed by Capt. Spicer, the Adjutancy being filled
by Capt. A. Grover (1st Bedfordshire Regiment), who
had just been transferred to the 2/4th Battalion at the
request of Lieut.-Col. Dann.</p>

<p>The long frost had now been succeeded by a remarkably
sudden thaw which created conditions of marked discomfort
in the trenches. The water pent up in the soil
for so long filled all the trenches to a depth of about two
feet, and the trench walls everywhere began to fall in,
throwing an enormous amount of work on the occupying
battalions in keeping them in a defensible condition.</p>

<p>By night our patrols continued their activities, but
each night on approaching the enemy's lines were met
with brisk machine-gun fire, which showed increasing
activity each day. The Battalion observers also reported
daily columns of smoke in rear of the enemy's lines,
arising, as was found subsequently, from the systematic
orgy of destruction in which the Germans indulged prior
to their retirement. There was, moreover, during these
few days a very marked increase of shelling in our back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
areas, the villages of Pommier, Berles, Bretencourt and
Bailleulmont all receiving an unusually large amount of
heavy fire.</p>

<p>The 11th proved to be the most disturbed day of this
tour of duty, the enemy being exceedingly active in
machine-gun and trench mortar fire. About 100 light
shells, of which many were gas, fell in Bienvillers, fortunately
without inflicting loss on the Battalion. On the 12th
the 2/4th Londons were relieved by the 2/1st Londons and
moved in Brigade reserve to Pommier, where they continued
training. The XVIII Corps Commander inspected
the Battalion on the 16th.</p>

<p>The Battalion Orderly Room now began to be inundated
by the Brigade Intelligence Staff with plans,
maps and all kinds of collated information as to the villages
which would lie in the line of the Division's expected
advance. All preparations were made for an immediate move.
Units in reserve were held in instant readiness to advance,
their first line transport wagons standing ready packed.</p>

<p>The night of the 16th/17th March was unusually
quiet, and patrols pushed out by the 2/1st Londons about
daybreak on the 17th returned with the information
that the German trenches about Monchy were deserted.
A patrol sent forward from the 2/4th Battalion under
Capt. Bottomley was able to penetrate into Monchy itself
and returned about midday with the definite assurance
that the village was evacuated.</p>

<p>The same day the order was given for a general advance
of the whole of the British forces from Arras to Roye.</p>

<p>That afternoon the 173rd Brigade moved forward, the
2/1st Londons occupying the German front line at Monchy
and some high ground south of the village, while the 2/4th
Battalion was brought forward from Brigade reserve,
"leap-frogging" through the leading Battalion to the
German trenches east of the village. A Company pushed
ahead and reached a point about 300 yards west of Adinfer
Wood. Here the Battalion was in touch with the 6th
South Staffords on the right. North of Monchy village
the 2/2nd Londons continued the line with the 174th
Brigade on their left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>The withdrawal of the Germans from the Monchy Salient
involved a continual shortening of our lines as the salient
became straightened out, and in order to effect this the
2/1st Londons were withdrawn on the night of the 17th
to Pommier, while the 2/4th Battalion continued its
advance, "squeezing-out" the 2/2nd Londons as it pushed
forward. By 5 p.m. the following day it had reached a
position near Rabbit Wood, a small copse on the North
side of Adinfer Wood, its left being now in touch with the
175th Brigade while the 46th Division kept pace with its
advance on the right.</p>

<p>At midnight on the 18th/19th March the 2/4th Londons
were withdrawn in Brigade reserve to Ransart, which
village was now occupied by Brigade Headquarters. A
few hours later, at 4.30 a.m. on the 19th, the 2/1st Londons
once more took up the advance towards Boiry-Becquerelle.</p>

<p>The advance of the 19th March covered a depth of
nearly 10,000 yards, and as it was achieved with very little
fighting it seems evident that the Germans' preparations
for withdrawal had been conducted with great skill. From
the time when they had left their original line at Monchy
they had almost entirely eluded close touch with our
pursuing columns, which were never able to harass their
retirement to any useful extent. Very little war material
fell into our hands, and it seems possible that valuable
hours were lost on the 17th before the order to follow up
the retirement reached battalions in the line.</p>

<p>The pursuit of the Germans was rendered exceedingly
slow and arduous by the unspeakable destruction which
met our advancing columns at every step. Cross roads
had been mined and vast craters forced all wheeled traffic
to deviate on to the sodden fields adjoining. Trees had
been felled across the roads and added to the impediments
to the advance of our artillery. Everywhere the Germans
had committed wanton destruction&mdash;young fruit trees
were ringed, crops were burnt wholesale, and every sort
of live stock had been driven before them in their retreat.
The aspect of the villages was most peculiar. At a
distance they appeared to be untouched, and the red roofs
of the cottages showed nothing unusual. On a closer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
approach, however, they were found to be ruined and the
walls knocked down so that the roofs had subsided intact to
the ground. Furniture, too heavy to be moved, had shared
in this destruction, and its débris was lying shattered among
the heaps of brick and stone. Yet further abominations
had been invented, and a series of ingenious "booby-traps"
were discovered in the shape of common articles
such as shovels and helmets. These were left lying about
in places where they were likely to be picked up by our
troops, and being connected with bombs and even large
mines caused explosions when they were touched.</p>

<p>By noon on the 19th March the 2/1st Londons had
established themselves after some opposition from machine-gun
fire on the line between Boiry-Becquerelle and
Boyelles, in touch with the 46th Division in Hamelincourt;
but further efforts to advance from this position towards St
Leger, which was the objective for the day, were effectually
stopped by heavy enemy shell and machine-gun fire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the 2/4th Londons were once more moved
forward, leaving Ransart at about 3 p.m., and by 5.30 had
advanced to the line of the Boyelles-St Leger Railway
on the right of the 2/1st Londons.</p>

<p>The 173rd Brigade now occupied the whole of the
58th Divisional front, being in touch with the Division
on its right and its left joining the 30th Division who were
facing Henin-sur-Cojeul. The line occupied by the 2/4th
and 2/1st Londons formed a marked re-entrant in the
British line, overlooking a valley which runs in a northerly
direction from St Leger to Henin-sur-Cojeul. The enemy
had apparently deployed on the further side of this valley
and was holding the line of the Henin-Croisilles Road.
Opposite the right flank of the 2/4th Londons he had for
the moment considerable advantage of ground over us,
as our line was dominated by a hill which protected
Croisilles from observation. The following day the Brigade
consolidated itself in this position, Brigade Headquarters
moving forward to Boiry-St Rictrude, which was also
occupied by the 2/3rd Londons in Brigade reserve, while
the 2/2nd Londons moved into close support in Boisleux-au-Mont.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>The line held by the Brigade extended from Judas
Farm near St Leger, where it was in close touch with the
Division on the right, in front of Boyelles and Boiry-Becquerelle
to the north branch of the Cojeul River.
North of the river the line was continued by the 30th
Division, who were endeavouring to force the villages
of St Martin and Henin.</p>

<p>The Battalion had pushed outposts beyond its main
line on the railway to the Boiry-St Leger Road, but all
attempts to continue the general advance beyond this
line were frustrated by the heavy machine-gun and shell
fire with which the enemy sprayed the forward slopes of
the ridge down which the advance was to be made. At
the same time signs were not wanting that his withdrawal
had not reached its limit, for fires were observed in
Henin and Croisilles which indicated that the systematic
destruction which hitherto had been the prelude to his
retirement was proceeding with unabated vigour.</p>

<p>On the 21st the 2/4th Londons were relieved by the
2/3rd in the right subsector and withdrew to Boiry-St
Martin in reserve. For three days the Battalion remained
here under conditions of extreme discomfort. The weather
was exceptionally severe and the ground was covered with
snow, while the open and bare hillsides were swept by
biting winds. Billets were non-existent owing to the total
destruction of the village, so that the change from the
front line to reserve brought very little of rest or easier
conditions. Indeed throughout this period of the advance
the terrible exposure proved a far more serious enemy
than the Germans themselves, and the casualties caused
through it were five times more numerous than those
caused by wounds.</p>

<p>The Hindenburg line was now within measurable
distance, and the salient previously held by the enemy
being almost entirely flattened out it was found possible
to withdraw several divisions now in action. This was
the more desirable not only for the provision of as many
reserve divisions as possible for the impending offensive
against the Vimy Ridge, but also for the tasks of rendering
the devastated region covered by the advance habitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
to our forces, of repairing the ruined roads, and of bringing
forward the supplies of material necessary for further
operations. One of the important gains of the advance
was the reopening of direct lateral communication
between Arras and Albert. With their usual thoroughness
the Germans had completely destroyed the railway connecting
these two towns, the track being torn up and the
bridges demolished; and the complete reconstruction of
it presented one of the most pressing necessities in the
organisation of the new defences.</p>

<p>The 58th Division, in accordance with this programme,
was now withdrawn, and on the 25th March the 173rd
Brigade handed over its sector to the 174th and withdrew
to Pommier, the 2/4th Londons being billeted at Monchy
and put to work on repairing the roads.</p>

<p>Each Brigade of the Division now became split up and
battalions and companies were scattered far afield on one
or other of the necessary works, of which a few have been
enumerated above.</p>

<p>On the 28th the 2/4th Londons moved further back
from the line to Grenas (on the Doullens-Arras Road) leaving
behind it two companies, A and C, which were attached to
VII Corps troops (C Company joining the 56th Division)
for road repairing at Wailly and Arras respectively.</p>

<p>At the end of the month the Division, now attached
to XIX Corps, was concentrated, with the exception of
the detachments referred to, in the area of Frohen-le-Grand,
between Doullens and Auxi-le-Château, and on
the 1st April the 2/4th Battalion, less A and C Companies,
marched to fresh billets in Bonnières, continuing their
route the following day to Vitz Villeroy, some four miles
west of Auxi-le-Château.</p>

<p>From the beginning of March the Battalion had experienced
continual rough handling, not only from enemy
machine-gun and shell fire, but also from the remarkable
amount of marching and counter-marching and exposure
to the elements which the pursuit of the Germans had
entailed. It must also be borne in mind that they had a
month previously been raw troops of whom practically
none had been under fire. The writer is, therefore, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
all the more pleasure able to testify to the excellent bearing
and strict march discipline of the Battalion as it swung
through Auxi-le-Château on the 2nd April. But if the
2/4th Battalion expected rest after its labours it was soon
to learn how illusive rest can be in modern war, for the
next day it returned to Auxi and embussed to Beaumetz-les-Loges
in the Arras area, when it once more took the
road and marched to Boiry-St Martin. Accommodation
here was provided for Headquarters and B Company in
old German dugouts, while D Company contented itself
with temporary and hastily constructed shelters in the
village.</p>

<p>A week of hard work in laying new track on the Arras-Albert
Railway followed, and on the 12th the Battalion,
having been rejoined by A and C Companies, moved to
Pommier and thence to Achiet-le-Grand, where the remainder
of the 173rd, now under command of Brig.-Gen.
Freyberg, V.C., D.S.O., was concentrated.</p>

<p>The Division was now in the Fifth Army area (Gough)
and attached to the V Corps.</p>

<p>The remainder of April, with the exception of short
spells of training, was entirely devoted to working parties,
the principal tasks entrusted to the 2/4th Londons being
the formation of a large R.E. dump at Achiet-le-Grand,
the construction of a light railway at Ervillers and the
repair of the Ervillers-St Leger Road.</p>

<p>During the period under review the Battalion received
one or two small reinforcements of N.C.O.'s and men, and
also the following officers:</p>

<div class="hangindent8">

<p>18th March&mdash;2/Lieuts. G. H. Hetley, C. A. Clarke, S. M. Williams and
G. E. Lester, and 2/Lieut. Acason (18th Londons).</p>

<p>27th April&mdash;2/Lieut. S. A. Seys (15th Londons).</p></div>

<p>Casualties included Major W. A. Nunneley, gassed;
2/Lieut. R. K. Caparn, wounded; 2/Lieuts. A. M. Duthie
and S. P. Ferdinando, accidentally wounded; 2/Lieuts.
H. W. Hallett and G. G. Hunt, sick; and in N.C.O.'s and
men 10 killed, 25 wounded, and about 170 sick, chiefly
from exposure.</p>

<p>The duties of signalling officer were taken by 2/Lieut.
E. C. Pratt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>In February the Battalion was unfortunate in losing
2/Lieut. C. J. Graham, who joined Brigade Headquarters
as Intelligence Officer. He filled this appointment with
great success until March 1918, when he was appointed
Brigade Major in the 47th Division. He was decorated
with the D.S.O. and the M.C. with Bar.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

THE 1/4TH BATTALION IN THE BATTLES OF ARRAS, 1917</h2>


<p>Reverting now to the 1/4th Battalion, we have the task
of recording its part in the great battles of April and May
1917 which developed after the German retirement, some
account of which has been attempted in the preceding
chapter.</p>

<p>On transfer from the First Army area the 1/4th
Battalion was billeted at Le Souich late on the evening
of the 10th March 1917. The following day was Sunday
and was observed as far as possible as a rest, and this day
the Battalion was joined by a reinforcement of officers,
2/Lieuts. J. F. Elders, T. Caudwell, S. Minear, C. J. Reid
and E. C. Hayes, all attached from the Queen's Westminsters.
On the 12th the Battalion marched in drenching
rain to Ivergny, the next village to Le Souich, but on arrival
the billets were found to be already occupied, and orders
were received to move a mile further on to Beaudricourt,
which village was reached about 4.30 p.m.</p>

<p>At Beaudricourt the Battalion settled down to a steady
course of company training in preparation for active
operations. According to the Battalion custom, whenever
possible, the day's work was started by Commanding
Officer's parade, and the strictest attention was paid to
all points of parade discipline; while the drums beat
Retreat each evening in the village street. The training
included a good deal of route marching to harden the
troops after their long sojourn in trenches, practice attacks
from trench to trench, and "specialist" training, in the
course of which every man in the Battalion received the
rudiments of instruction in the Lewis gun. The opportunity
was also taken to reorganise the companies in
accordance with the then newly-evolved scheme, which
had the object of rendering the platoon a self-contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
fighting unit comprising only fighting ranks. The four
sections of the platoon were definitely organised as one
of Lewis gunners, one of riflemen, one of rifle-grenadiers
and one of bombers; and all administrative details in the
company, such as cooks, stretcher-bearers and company
runners, were collected into a "headquarter" section
under the immediate supervision of the company second
in command.</p>

<p>The advantages of the new platoon organisation were
evidenced by practical demonstrations to the officers of
the division of methods of employing the various sections
in co-operation with each other in operations such as the
capture of a strong point. These demonstrations were
given by a selected platoon of the Rangers, and Gen. Hull
took the opportunity of announcing to the assembled
officers the rôle which it was expected the Division would
play in the coming attack.</p>

<p>In the latter part of March the Battalion lost three
officers, 2/Lieuts. S. P. Stotter and R. W. Chamberlain to
hospital, and Capt. F. C. Grimwade seconded to VII Corps
School as Instructor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The intention of G.H.Q. for the offensive of 1917 was
to deliver a heavy blow against the German positions in
the Scarpe-Ancre Salient (see Map No. 9); and in conjunction
with this, and in order to secure the left flank
of the attack, to wrest from the enemy his commanding
positions on the Vimy Ridge, whence excellent observation
could be obtained over the Plains of Douai. This scheme
underwent considerable modifications before it was put
into operation, firstly to secure closer co-operation with
the French offensive on the Aisne; and secondly by
reason of the German Retirement of March 1917, which
altered the rôle of the Fifth Army and compelled them to
re-establish themselves in fresh positions facing the
Hindenburg line.</p>

<p>The Hindenburg line in the vicinity of its junction
with the original German trench lines south-east of Arras
being the centre of the Battalion's operations in April and
May, a reference to the map will be of assistance to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
reader in appreciating what follows. It will be seen that
the old trench systems (<em>i.e.</em> those held by the enemy until
March) crossed the valley of the Scarpe running southwards
through the eastern suburbs of Arras, as far as the Arras-Cambrai
Road, and then swinging south-westward followed
the valley of the Crinchon River. These trenches consisted
of two main systems about 2000 yards apart, the village
of Beaurains being incorporated into the first system and
that of Tilloy-les-Mofflaines into the second, with Mercatel
and Neuville-Vitasse in rear of the second system. About
three-quarters of a mile south of Tilloy was Telegraph
Hill, the line between being strengthened by the enormously
fortified redoubt known as The Harp. From the
southern extremity of The Harp the new Hindenburg line
(or rather system of trenches) struck off south-eastward,
including Neuville-Vitasse, crossing the valley of the
Cojeul River between St Martin and Heninel and passing
thence between Croisilles and Fontaine. Between the
west side of the Cojeul valley and the Scarpe at Fampoux
was a "switch" line known as the Wancourt line, which
crossed the Cambrai Road just east of Feuchy Chapel.</p>

<p>The task originally allotted to the 56th Division was
the capture of Beaurains and Telegraph Hill.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The 169th Brigade which had left the Neuve Chapelle
area in advance of the remainder of the Division had been
placed in line at Agny, opposite Beaurains, and to this
point the commanding officers of the 168th Brigade proceeded
on the 17th March to make the preliminary reconnaissance
for the attack. But the following day it was
found that Beaurains was clear of enemy and was already
occupied by the 169th Brigade who were following up
energetically. The reconnaissance being no longer required
the party returned to billets pending further orders.</p>

<p>On the 18th Lieut.-Col. A. E. Maitland, M.C. (Essex
Regiment), was appointed to command the Battalion, and
on the 23rd the Division moved forward into a concentration
area in rear of Arras, the Battalion marching
from Beaudricourt at 9.30 a.m. and arriving in billets
at Beaumetz-les-Loges at 4.30 p.m. At Beaumetz the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Battalion resumed its training programme though the
whole Brigade was held at short notice to move in view
of the possible further development of the enemy's withdrawal.</p>

<p>It is worth while pausing for a moment to consider the
extraordinary achievement of G.H.Q. in delivering the
Arras-Vimy Ridge attack as it did on the 9th April. The
preparations were on similar lines to those for the Somme
offensive of the previous July, and were on an even vaster
scale owing to the increased number of the divisions
which it was proposed to employ and to the ever-growing
strength and weight of the British artillery. The preliminary
work of forming reinforcement and concentration
camps, laying fresh and increasing the capacity of existing
railway lines, arranging for water supply, dumps of
munitions and <em>matériel</em>, establishment of hospitals and the
hundred and one other essential tasks had been steadily
proceeding since the close of the Somme offensive in
November 1916.</p>

<p>Imagine, then, the inevitable dislocation of the scheme
when, a comparatively few days before the attack was to
be delivered, the enemy suddenly withdrew on part of
the front from the positions it had been intended to
assault and betook himself within fortified lines of enormous
strength to the rear. Dumps, railheads, hospitals, water-supply,
concentration areas, guns, heavy siege and light, all
had to be pushed forward to fresh and rapidly selected
positions in an area which had been laid waste with all
the fiendish skill of which a resourceful enemy was capable,
and all the consequent modifications of objectives and
orders effected at the shortest possible notice. Not only
was this achieved, but it was achieved with such efficiency
as to produce on the 9th April the most striking single-day
success which had crowned the British Armies since the
outbreak of the War.</p>

<p>The Battalion was soon called on for its share in this
"moving forward" process of the preparations for battle,
and on the 28th March it marched with the remainder of
the Brigade to positions in the old British trench system
opposite Beaurains, where for three days it was engaged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
supplying working parties. On the 1st April it was withdrawn
to Brigade reserve in Achicourt where it found
comfortable billets. A very large number of British
heavy batteries were in action here registering and wire-cutting
for the coming battle, and the continuous din of
our own guns was trying. The shells of one battery of
60-pounders firing from just in rear of the Headquarters
billet cleared the roof of the house by about 18 inches.</p>

<p>In the meantime the pursuit of the Germans had been
maintained by the 56th Division, which with the 21st and
30th on its right and the 14th on its left comprised the
VII Corps (D'Oyly Snow). A relief had been effected on
the 1st April, the 168th and 167th Brigades taking over
the Divisional sector from the 169th which was withdrawn
to reserve. By the 2nd April, the Germans having reached
the Hindenburg system, the line became stabilised, and no
further important alteration occurred until the day of
battle. When the Battalion took over the advanced
trenches from the Rangers on the 3rd, therefore, the
positions which they occupied formed practically the
"start-line" for the 9th April.</p>

<p>The 56th Division occupied a salient of which the
north-eastern face was on the Beaurains-Neuville-Vitasse
Road, and the south-eastern face lay opposite the north-west
corner of Neuville-Vitasse. On this side the British
positions had been pushed forward in the direction of
Neuville-Vitasse and posts were held in the old German
communication trenches leading back to the village.</p>

<p>This sector was held by the Battalion with three companies
in the front line and one in reserve in a system
known as the Circular Work south-east of Beaurains. It
will be readily appreciated that as the advanced British
positions were outposts in different communication trenches
it was necessary in order to provide a good jumping-off line
for the battle to connect these up by continuous trenches
to form a front line, to supply that front line with support
lines and feed it with fresh communication trenches.
Clearly a good deal of digging was necessary in a very
short space of time, and the Battalion was heavily engaged
in this work during its tour of duty, which lasted until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
the 7th April. The principal trenches dug were Deodar,
Poplar, Lime, Elm and Skin in the front system, and Gun,
How and New Battery as communication trenches.</p>

<p>On the 4th April the British destructive bombardment
began and continued daily according to a prearranged
programme until the day of battle. This met with comparatively
little retaliation.</p>

<p>On the 7th an inter-battalion relief was effected, the
Battalion vacating the line in favour of the Kensingtons
and Rangers who were respectively detailed as right and
left assaulting battalions. The London Scottish moved
to the old British line at Agny while the 1/4th Londons
returned to dugouts in the railway cutting at Achicourt.
The following day battle positions were occupied, the
London Scottish moving forward to close support in rear
of the Kensingtons, and the 1/4th Londons to Brigade
reserve in the Circular Work.</p>

<p>The Division's objectives for the 9th April were as
follows:</p>

<p>The 168th (left) and 167th (right) Brigades were to
advance through Neuville-Vitasse to the first objective
which was an arbitrary line (the Blue line) skirting the
east edge of the village and facing the Hindenburg system.
(<em>Note.</em>&mdash;The Hindenburg line between Telegraph Hill and
the Cojeul River was known as the Cojeul Switch.) This
first phase was entrusted in the 168th to the Kensingtons
and Rangers, the latter battalion on the left being prepared
to adopt special measures and form a defensive flank
facing north should the 14th Division be checked at
Telegraph Hill.</p>

<p>After a pause on this objective of about four and a
half hours the London Scottish (168th) and 1st Londons
(167th) were to "leapfrog" through the leading troops
and carry the Cojeul Switch, the Scottish objectives being
Back, Card and Telegraph Hill trenches (north of the
Neuville-Vitasse-Wancourt Road). Here a further pause
was to be made, after which the third phase of the battle
would be taken up by the 167th Brigade, who would
advance, covering the whole Divisional frontage on to the
Wancourt line (Brown line).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>To return to the 1/4th Battalion. The day spent in
Achicourt prior to manning battle positions produced the
first serious German retaliation to our bombardment. As
already remarked Achicourt was "stiff" with batteries
and also contained a very extensive and important
ammunition dump. Doubtless the Bosche decided that
the quickest way to silence our guns was to destroy their
supplies of shell, and from 11.30 a.m. until 5 p.m. he
bombarded the village, causing a good many casualties in
the Battalion and firing several houses which formed part
of the dump. The village square, moreover, was packed
with lorries loaded with shell waiting to move forward
with the batteries, and unluckily the enemy obtained some
direct hits on these. For some time the flying fragments
rendered the place remarkably unhealthy. Excellent work
was done in saving two lorries by Major H. Campbell of
the Kensingtons. He well earned his D.S.O. by driving
two of the blazing lorries out of the square into a place
of safety.</p>

<p>The battle positions occupied that night by the
Battalion were as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table width="90%" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="battle positions">

    <td>Company </td>
    <td>(Stanbridge)&mdash;Attached as "moppers-up" to the Kensingtons.</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

<p>The role of the Battalion was laid down to provide for
various eventualities that might arise according to the
degree of success achieved by the assaulting battalions,
and it was therefore held in readiness either to assist the
Rangers in forming a defensive flank in case of failure by
the division on the left, or to lend weight to the Scottish
attack on the Cojeul Switch.</p>

<p>At 5.30 a.m. on the 9th April, after a hurricane bombardment
of the German lines, the British barrage lifted
and the attack began. The advance of the 56th Division
was deferred until two hours later to allow the 14th
Division, whose start-line was less advanced, to come into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
line, and accordingly at 7.30 a.m. the Rangers and Kensingtons
moved to the assault, followed by B Company of
the 1/4th Londons who were equipped with Stokes mortar
shells for dealing with deep dugouts.</p>

<p>B Company's job in mopping-up proved easier than had
been expected, for the German trench garrisons had been
confined to their deep dugouts for some days by the
intensity of our bombardment, and the resultant difficulties
with which they had been faced in getting their
rations and water up from the rear made them on the
whole not undisposed to surrender; and in a short time
the Battalion, in Brigade reserve, was cheered by the sight
of bodies of German prisoners marching in fours down the
road to Beaurains in a dazed and exhausted condition.</p>

<p>By 9.30 a.m. the Blue line on the whole of the Brigade
front was in our hands, and its consolidation was at once
put in hand by the assaulting troops with assistance from
the 512th Company R.E. and a company of the Cheshire
Pioneers. At 11.20 a.m. the Scottish moved forward on
a three company front to attack the Cojeul Switch. Their
advance was met with heavy machine-gun fire, and
although one company succeeded in gaining Back Trench,
the furthest of the three lines forming the Cojeul Switch,
and in pushing patrols beyond it, the battalion was forced
ultimately to fall back to Telegraph Hill Trench, the front
line of the Switch System and that nearest to Neuville-Vitasse.</p>

<p>At 12.30 p.m. the 1/4th Londons were ordered to
advance to fresh positions on the western edge of Neuville-Vitasse,
where they came under the orders of the 167th
Brigade. The move was completed by 4 p.m. with A
Company in Tree, C in Leaf and D in Pine; B Company
(still under the orders of the Kensingtons) having by now
withdrawn to reorganise in Deodar Lane after their fight.</p>

<p>As reports of the attack on the Cojeul Switch came in
it became clear that a gap existed between the London
Scottish and the 7th Middlesex, who had advanced to the
assistance of the 1st Londons on their right, and at 5 p.m.
Brigade ordered the Battalion forward to fill this gap.
The three available companies moved forward at once, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
on emerging from Neuville-Vitasse it was found that touch
had been regained by the Scottish and the Middlesex, and
the companies therefore took up a position on the eastern
edge of the village in support to the Middlesex.</p>

<p>In the meantime the third phase of the attack, namely,
the advance of the 167th Brigade to the Wancourt line,
had been definitely checked by machine-gun fire, as had
also that of the 14th Division on the left; so that the
day's fighting ended with the 14th Division in possession
of Telegraph Hill and The Harp, and the northern end of
the Cojeul Switch; the 56th occupying the Cojeul Switch
astride the Neuville-Vitasse-Wancourt Road; and the
30th on the right approaching the Wancourt line in
the vicinity of the Neuville-Vitasse-Henin Road&mdash;a very
substantial advance for the day.</p>

<p>The 168th Brigade captures for the day amounted to
5 officers and 635 other ranks, all of the 163rd R. I. Regt.,
9 machine-guns, 2 granatenwerfer, 1 minenwerfer, and 2
heavy trench mortars, together with large quantities of
small arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>In the evening the Battalion was rejoined by B Company,
and Battalion Headquarters advanced to a dugout
in rear of the start-line for the day. The night was marked
by bombing operations in the Cojeul Switch which had
the wholesome effect of clearing out the few remaining
pockets of Bosche, and by 7.30 a.m. on the 10th touch had
been gained with the 14th Division on the left, while the
56th Division's right had been extended further south and
the London Scottish had possessed themselves of the
whole of the Back-Card-Telegraph Hill system.</p>

<p>A remarkable instance of initiative on the part of a
private soldier, which occurred on the night of the 9th April,
is worth recording. Pte. Turner, a runner of D Company,
lost his company and strayed into the German line.
Finding a dugout entrance he began to descend the stairs,
when he heard voices; and as the owners of the voices
were evidently Huns he announced his arrival by throwing
a Mills bomb down the dugout. The occupants apparently
thought they were outnumbered and promptly gave
themselves up to the number of 1 officer and 16 other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
ranks. Turner marshalled his bag in a shell hole outside,
and the next morning was found with them, all apparently
quite content to be under the leadership of one British
private, outside Neuville-Vitasse. Turner's coolness was
rewarded with the Military Medal.</p>

<p>Early on the 10th the weather, which had hitherto
been cold and wet, became yet worse and the landscape
was soon white with snow, from which trenches and shell
holes gave no protection.</p>

<p>Immediate arrangements were made by VII Corps to
complete the previous day's objectives, and an attack on
the Wancourt line was delivered at noon, the 56th Division
attack being entrusted to the 167th Brigade. During
this attack the 1/4th Londons remained in support and
withdrew to their former position in the trenches on the
western edge of Neuville-Vitasse.</p>

<p>The assault of the 10th April was only partly successful
on the Corps front, but the pressure was maintained on
the 11th. By noon on that day the 56th Division, whose
advance had developed into a flank attack along the
Hindenburg line, had cleared the Cojeul Switch as far
south as the Cojeul River and occupied the villages of
Wancourt and Heninel.</p>

<p>While these successes had been gained south of the
Scarpe an equally striking victory had been gained north
of the river where the XVII Corps (Fergusson) of the
Third Army and the Canadians (Byng) and 1 Corps
(Holland) of the First Army had swept the enemy from
his long established positions on the Vimy Ridge to the
plain east of it, and had sensibly tightened our grip on
the mining area of Lens.</p>

<p>Preparations were at once made to follow up this very
striking success, and VII Corps issued orders for the
advance to be resumed on the 14th over the watershed
dividing the Cojeul valley from that of the Sensée. The
13th was therefore devoted to preparations for this attack,
in forming advanced dumps and moving forward batteries,
and the 168th Brigade was placed under orders to advance
at short notice, though no actual move occurred during
the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 14th April the enemy barrage was much heavier
than it had been on the 9th, and under a murderous fire
the 169th Brigade, which attacked on the 56th Division's
front, was forced after some initial success back to its
start-line. That night the 168th Brigade was ordered forward
to form a defensive flank in the Cojeul Switch facing
north-east, and accordingly the 1/4th Battalion moved
after dark from the Back-Card-Telegraph Hill area, which
they had occupied earlier in the day, to relieve the Queen's
Westminsters on the right of the advanced line, with the
London Scottish on their left and the Kensingtons and
Rangers respectively in support and reserve.</p>

<p>The relief was completed by 4 a.m. on the 15th with
the exception of an advanced post pushed well down the
forward slope of the valley towards Heninel. This was
allotted to two platoons of B Company, but owing to the
complete devastation of the area, and the absence of landmarks,
the guides detailed to these platoons failed to find
the post, and its relief had to be postponed until the
following evening.</p>

<p>The Battalion now experienced another change of
command, and Lieut.-Col. Maitland having fallen sick it
was taken over by Major H. Campbell, D.S.O., attached
from the Kensingtons to command with the acting rank
of Lieut.-Col. as from the 12th April.</p>

<p>The 15th proved to be a day of inaction, though the
enemy's artillery was continuously active over the whole
Battalion area. No further advance was attempted on
the 16th and no action occurred during the early hours of
the day, with the exception of a local counter-attack by
the enemy, directed against the 50th Division on our left,
in the course of which he managed to re-establish himself
on the ridge in the vicinity of Wancourt Tower.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the hostile shelling slackened
considerably, but at about 4.30 p.m. warning was received
that he was preparing a counter-attack in force, and at
7.30 a barrage of terrific intensity fell on the Battalion's
trenches. The front line companies in accordance with
the prearranged scheme of defence at once cleared the
advanced trenches and pushed forward Lewis gun sections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
about 60 yards into No Man's Land in order to smash up
any attack that might be delivered. By this time darkness
was gathering and movement becoming hard to detect.
At about 8 o'clock, however, the enemy was observed
advancing in close formation to the attack. Our Lewis
guns at once opened fire and were magnificently supported
by the artillery. The attack was completely smashed and
no German reached our lines. The enemy barrage continued
without abatement for about an hour, during
which the whole Battalion area was effectively searched
and a great many casualties caused. By 9 p.m., however,
the bombardment slackened, and after a few hours of
desultory shelling died out altogether.</p>

<p>During the evening the sector held by the London
Scottish was also subjected to severe shelling but no
infantry action occurred, and it was evident that the
whole weight of the attack had fallen on the 1/4th Londons'
sector. The heaps of German dead which were visible in
No Man's Land on the following day bore striking testimony
to the accuracy of the Battalion's Lewis gun fire.</p>

<p>During the attack excellent work was done under
heavy fire by the medical officer, Capt. Havard, R.A.M.C.,
and the medical orderlies. The Aid Post was merely a
corrugated iron shed built in the side of a sunken road
and afforded no cover from the shell splinters which were
flying in all directions.</p>

<p>The 17th April passed without incident on the
Battalion's front, though on the left the 50th Division
recaptured Wancourt Tower, the possession of which gave
us complete command of the high ground between the
Cojeul and the Sensée. That evening an inter-battalion
relief took place, the Rangers relieving the 1/4th Londons
and the Kensingtons taking over from the London Scottish.
The relief of A Company had, however, to be postponed
until the following night owing to the approach of daylight.</p>

<p>On relief the Battalion withdrew to deep dugouts in
the Cojeul Switch about 800 yards west of Heninel. These
were large and well constructed, and accommodated the
whole Battalion underground without overcrowding. The
strength of the position was enormous, and it seemed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
matter for congratulation that the British attack had
succeeded in dislodging the former occupants with comparatively
so little opposition. It pointed to the fact that
no well-defined earthwork defence is in the long-run proof
against an attack delivered by well-trained troops supported
by tanks and a sufficient weight of heavy artillery; and
indeed, as will be seen later, the capture of "pillboxes"
and scattered shell hole defences proved a greater obstacle
in the third Battle of Ypres later in the summer.</p>

<p>The 56th Division was now withdrawn to Corps
reserve; and after spending a day in the dugouts the
Battalion was relieved on the afternoon of the 19th by
the 16th Manchesters (30th Division), withdrawing after
relief to billets in Arras.</p>

<p>Although the opening phases of the offensive involved
the Battalion in comparatively little fighting, it had been
continuously engaged in the general rough-and-tumble
of shell holes and subjected to fairly continuous shell fire
since the opening of the battle. Its losses during this
period amounted in officers to: 2/Lieut. T. Siddall, killed;
2/Lieuts. P. Pyne and L. W. N. Jones, wounded; Rev.
S. F. Leighton Green, C.F., wounded at duty.</p>

<p>The battle had now completely achieved its object
as originally conceived by G.H.Q. The enemy was dislodged
from the high ground on a wide front, and
the resultant change of positions afforded our troops
advantages of observation and drier foothold; and had
Sir Douglas Haig been a free agent he would at once
have transferred his intentions to the northern area, where
he was desirous of launching his Messines and Ypres
offensives. In deference to the needs of our Allies, however,
it was necessary to keep the Germans active without
respite on the Arras front to which they had already
drawn large reserves, and this was the more important
in view of the ghastly collapse of the Russian Empire
and the consequent liberation of enemy troops for the
Western Front. Active operations were, therefore, pursued
for some time longer on the Arras front, though
perhaps they should not strictly be regarded as part of
the Battle of Arras.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>After the withdrawal of the 56th Division from the
line, fighting broke out again on a wide front both sides
of the Scarpe on the 23rd April, and continued with bitterness
until the 26th though with comparatively little
success. Some progress was made on both sides of the
Cojeul River, and the village of Guémappe added to the
British gains.</p>

<p>The 19th April was the occasion of the Battalion's
first visit to Arras, with which town it became so intimately
connected in the later stages of the War. At
this date the town was not seriously damaged although
it had lain a short two miles from the German lines for
over two years, and with the exception of the railway
station and its immediate vicinity was still quite healthy
for reserve billets. The Battalion was accommodated in
the barracks of the Citadel, which formed a welcome change
from sixteen days of shell holes and dugouts. On the 21st
the Battalion embussed for Bayencourt where it encamped
in the Coigneux valley. Two days were occupied here
in resting and reorganising, and advantage was taken
by all ranks during leisure hours of the opportunity to
revisit the Battalion's old haunts at Hébuterne and to
cross unmolested to Gommecourt Park. On the 24th the
Battalion moved at short notice to Gouy-en-Artois, arriving
in billets there at 8 p.m. While at Gouy the Battalion
was inspected by the Brigadier-General.</p>

<p>The 56th Division was now once more placed under
orders for the line, this time in the VI Corps area, the
sector held by the 15th Division being taken over by the
167th Brigade on the 29th April. The 168th Brigade,
being once again in Divisional reserve, moved from Gouy
to Simencourt on the 27th April, and on the following
day into Arras, where preparations for further active
operations were made in billets. The few days in Arras
were much enlivened by the excellent show given by the
Bow Bells in Arras Theatre.</p>

<p>The impending operation was to be an attempt to
break through the enemy's defences on a large scale, the
Fifth, Third and First Armies all being employed on a
front from Fontaine-lez-Croisilles through Chérisy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
St Rohart Factory to a point north of Plouvain. The
VI Corps, consisting of the 3rd and 56th Divisions in line,
took up the frontage from the Scarpe to the Cojeul River,
the 56th Division's objective being on a line running
north and south between St Rohart Factory on the Arras-Cambrai
Road and the Bois du Vert.</p>

<p>The sector now held by the Division was about 1000
yards east of Guémappe and Monchy-le-Preux and lay
sidelong on the spurs and side valleys descending to the
Cojeul River. The enemy's defences were far more difficult
to cope with on this occasion than on the 9th April.
The Hindenburg and Wancourt lines had been passed;
the Drocourt-Quéant line was still far ahead; and the
intervening area which was now to be attacked was intersected
in all directions by short isolated trench lines in
the siting of which the enemy had displayed his usual skill
in the use of ground. His defences, disposed in great
depth, were strengthened by large numbers of machine-guns
cunningly placed for mutual support in sunken roads
and shell holes. It was known, however, that the deep
dugouts of the Hindenburg line did not exist in this area,
and it was hoped that a heavy and continuous bombardment
beforehand would sufficiently reduce his numbers
and morale to give success to the British infantry.</p>

<p>The 56th Division attack was to be carried out by
the 167th and 169th Brigades, the 168th being relegated
to reserve, though available for the assistance of either
assaulting brigade as occasion might arise.</p>

<p>The Battalion remained in Arras until the 2nd May
when, warning being received that "zero" for the attack
was fixed for 3.45 a.m., the following day it moved at
4 p.m. to assembly in The Harp. In order to secure close
co-operation between the Brigades, 2/Lieut. O. D. Garratt
was attached to the 169th Headquarters as liaison officer.</p>

<p>The night of the 2nd May was fine and cold, though
the early hours were misty, and at 3.40 a.m. on the 3rd
when our bombardment increased to hurricane intensity it
was still almost dark. At this hour the Battalion stood to,
and the vivid flashes of the guns and the streams of S.O.S.
signals from the enemy lines showed that inferno had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
broken loose, and the attack had begun. The British
barrage was good, but the enemy was evidently expecting
the attack as his counter-barrage was quick and his
machine-gun fire devastating in volume and accuracy.</p>

<p>The 3rd May was a day of great disappointment all
along the line, and comparatively little success was
achieved. The 169th Brigade were held up by a German
strong post in Cavalry Farm and, after occupying a
precarious position between it and the river for some
hours, were forced back by a heavy counter-attack to
their original line. The 167th Brigade was also unable
to progress.</p>

<p>It seems clear that zero hour was too early. In the
darkness it was impossible for the troops to see visual
signals of command, and the delay caused by having to
pass messages down the line owing to the din of the
bombardment resulted in the attacking waves moving off
zig-zag in shape with officers at the advanced points. In
such a formation they became an easy target for the
enemy machine-guns. Some greater success might, moreover,
have been achieved had the creeping barrage
moved forward more quickly, which would have been
quite possible in view of the comparatively unbroken
state of the ground.</p>

<p>Early in the day the 1/4th Londons had moved forward
to positions in shell holes at Airy Corner, near Feuchy
Chapel, and at 8.30 p.m. the Battalion, now definitely at the
disposal of the 169th Brigade, received orders to advance
to positions in the Wancourt line just south of the Arras-Cambrai
Road. This move was followed by another at
11 p.m., which brought the Battalion into close support
of the front line in Tank Trench, apparently in anticipation
of a further German counter-attack. The forward
movement was made under a very heavy gas shell bombardment,
but gas helmets were worn and practically no
casualties were suffered. Shortly after arrival in the new
position the enemy shelling slackened, and as no further
action appeared imminent the Battalion was once more
withdrawn to the Wancourt line, the move again being
made in gas helmets. A move of 8000 yards in the dark
with respirators is no easy matter to troops laden with
battle equipment, and the men were somewhat exhausted
on regaining the reserve position. A few hours' rest,
however, put them to rights, and at 3 p.m. on the 4th the
Battalion was again under orders to move forward. The
losses of the 167th and 169th Brigades on the previous
day were so severe that immediate relief was necessary
for them, and the 168th Brigade therefore took over the
whole Divisional front; the Battalion relieving the Queen
Victorias and Queen's Westminsters in the subsector
between the Arras-Cambrai Road and the Cojeul River,
with the London Scottish on its left.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>The sector was occupied with two companies (C and D)
in the front line and two (A and B) in support, Headquarters
occupying a dugout on the hillside between
Guémappe and Wancourt. The relief was completed without
incident at 2.30 a.m. on the 5th May. The enemy
evidently anticipated a renewal of our attack for throughout
the day the lines were subjected to heavy shelling.
Some doubt existed as to whether the enemy still remained
in occupation of Cavalry Farm and of Tool Trench to the
north of it, and as no movement was visible two daylight
patrols were sent out in the afternoon to investigate.
These patrols managed to gain the edge of Cavalry Farm,
where they drew sharp rifle fire from the enemy which
caused some loss; and their object being gained the patrols
withdrew bringing their casualties with them. At about
10 p.m. the enemy's bombardment increased to a heavy
barrage, which was especially severe on the sector held by
the 14th Division on the right of the river, and it seemed
likely that an enemy attack was in preparation. The
14th Division indeed called for artillery support, and this
was promptly supplied by our artillery, which opened a
terrific barrage on the enemy lines. After an artillery
duel of about two hours the shelling on both sides
slackened. The 6th and 7th May were both marked by
heavy shelling, which on the part of the enemy seemed
mostly to be directed towards searching for our battery
positions in rear, though some loss was caused to the
Battalion, and 2/Lieuts. Reid and Caudwell were killed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
and 2/Lieut. Hutchins wounded, with several N.C.O.'s
and men killed and wounded by stray shells.</p>

<p>On the night of the 7th May the Battalion handed
over its sector to the Rangers and withdrew to the old
German trench system north of Wancourt, Headquarters
being accommodated in Marlière Caves. In this position
the Battalion remained a couple of days, during which
the enemy's shell fire continued at intervals but without
causing serious damage.</p>

<p>The attack of the 3rd May was the last general attack
on the Arras front, and subsequent operations were confined
to local enterprises up and down the line with the
object of improving and rounding off the positions gained.
On the Divisional front a minor operation of this sort was
immediately necessary in clearing up the situation at
Cavalry Farm and Tool Trench, and the 1/4th Londons
and London Scottish were detailed to capture these
positions.</p>

<p>The Battalion moved into the line for this attack on
the evening of the 10th May.</p>

<p>The objectives allotted to it were Cavalry Farm and
the trench south-east of it, and Tool Trench for a
frontage of 250 yards north of the Cambrai Road; while
the London Scottish were to extend the attack on Tool
Trench for a further 600 yards to the north and also
capture a small copse on the extreme left. The attack
was to be made in each battalion on a two company
front, each company advancing in two waves on a front of
two platoons. One company of the Rangers was attached
to the 1/4th Londons and one of Kensingtons to the
Scottish.</p>

<p>For two days previous to the 11th, which was fixed
for the operation, the Divisional artillery had been carrying
out destructive bombardments with 4·5-inch howitzers on
the objectives as well as on the communication trenches
leading to the rear and on the portion of Tool Trench
outside the limits of attack. On the evening of the 10th
a practice 18-pr. barrage was placed on the objectives,
but the enemy reply was so efficient that it was decided
to conduct the assault without any increase in our normal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
artillery activity and to endeavour to carry the operation
through as a surprise.</p>

<p>At 8.30 p.m. on the 11th May the assaulting waves
moved forward, the 1/4th Londons' attack led by D
Company (H. N. Williams) on the right of the road and
A Company (Lorden) on the left, with B (Beeby) and C
(Rees) Companies in support. The surprise effect was
excellent, and was heightened by the fact that all the
objectives except the Farm itself were hidden from our
trenches by a slight spur which here drops down to the
Cojeul River. The enemy had thus, in the absence of a
barrage, no warning of the attack, and in a few minutes
the whole of the objectives were captured. Few prisoners
were taken, but a party of about fifty of the enemy, fleeing
from Cavalry Farm, were caught by our Lewis guns and
annihilated. Lewis gun posts were at once pushed forward
into No Man's Land, and the consolidation of the captured
trench begun. So quickly had all this happened that the
enemy artillery opening in response to an S.O.S. sent up
from their lines was harmless to the leading companies,
though it inflicted some loss on the support companies
which were moving up to our vacated front line.</p>

<p>The consolidation of the captured position was aided
by the Cheshire Pioneers, who completed before dawn a
communication trench connecting Cavalry Trench with
the new front line.</p>

<p>In the early hours of the 12th May the line was thinned
out and only a sufficient garrison left in the captured
position to hold it against counter-attack, the surplus
platoons being withdrawn to the old line. After some
hours the German barrage subsided and we were left in
undisputed possession of our capture. This neat little
operation cost but few casualties considering the advantages
gained, and the completeness of the surprise is
illustrated by an incident which occurred early the
following morning. One of our advanced Lewis gun posts,
hearing movement in front, challenged. A reply being
received in German, fire was opened. Two of the team
went forward to collect the bag and found a German
officer shot dead and a Sergt.-Major badly wounded. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
maps which were taken from the officer's case showed
some of our battery positions accurately, and it appears
that this luckless pair were coming forward to Cavalry
Farm to "spot" for a German artillery shoot, ignorant
of the fact that it was in our hands.</p>

<p>The Battalion continued to occupy its new line until
the evening of the 13th May, when the 168th Brigade was
relieved by the 167th. The Battalion handed over its
sector to the 1/3rd Londons and withdrew to a reserve
position on the Cambrai Road near Tilloy, arriving there
in the early hours of the 14th May. The following day
a further move was made to billets in Arras.</p>

<p>After the Brigade's withdrawal from the line its gains
were extended on the 18th and 19th by successful local
operations carried out by the 167th Brigade, who completed
the captures of the north end of Tool Trench and
also parts of Hook and Long Trenches adjoining it.</p>

<p>On the 19th May the 168th Brigade moved still further
back to rest billets in Berneville, and two days later
the whole Division was withdrawn, with Divisional Headquarters
at Warlus.</p>

<p>During May the Battalion received the following
officer reinforcements:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Lieuts. E. P. M. Mosely and A. S. Ford.</p>

<p>2/Lieuts. L. W. Archer and H. T. Hannay (commissioned from

<p>Capt. Maloney, R.A.M.C., vice Havard to London Field
Ambulance.</p></div>

<p>During the same period 2/Lieut. Wreford was wounded
and Lieut. P. F. Smalley evacuated to hospital.</p>

<p>The Battalion remained in rest for about three weeks,
which were officially occupied in training and reorganisation.
The actual training was, however, reduced to the
minimum, and the Battalion's really serious duty became
that of training for Battalion and Brigade sports, and
the relaxation which these provided combined with the
determination with which all ranks strove to gain physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
fitness for the purpose of the sports was undoubtedly
quite as valuable as hours spent on the parade ground.
On the 23rd the Brigade was paraded for inspection by
Gen. Hull, who presented ribands to those who had been
decorated in the recent operations.</p>

<p>The following day the Battalion moved from Berneville
to fresh billets in Simencourt, where the routine of training
and recreation proceeded. Early in June the 56th Division
returned to the line, the 168th Brigade moving to Montenescourt
on the 11th and to Achicourt on the following day.</p>

<p>Eight days later the 168th Brigade relieved the 169th
in the line, the Battalion moving into left support positions
at Wancourt, where it relieved the 1/2nd Londons. Here
the Battalion remained for five days supplying working
parties chiefly in connection with the construction of new
communication trenches to connect up the recently gained
advance posts with the front line, and in connecting up
the posts themselves to form a new front line. These days
passed without incident beyond a certain amount of enemy
shelling and trench mortar fire, and on the evening of the
26th June the Battalion moved forward to relieve the
Kensingtons in the front line system, its right flank resting
on the Cojeul River, where it joined the London Scottish,
and its left flank about 800 yards north of the Arras-Cambrai
Road in Hook Trench. This relief was completed
by 1.30 a.m. on the 27th, and the sector was held with
three companies in front line and one in reserve.</p>

<p>This tour of duty passed without important incident
though the enemy's artillery exhibited some activity,
principally against the back areas in the neighbourhood of
Wancourt. On the 1st July hostile aircraft were especially
active, making many unsuccessful attempts to pass the
barrage of the British anti-aircraft batteries. This unusual
anxiety of the German airmen to cross our lines was
possibly due to the presence in the Arras area of H.M. the
King, who was then visiting the troops in France and
staying at Bavencourt Château on the Arras-Doullens Road.</p>

<p>That evening at 11 p.m. the 6th Queens of the 12th
Division took over the portion of the Battalion's sector
lying to the north of the Cambrai Road, and the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
evening the remainder of the sector was handed over to
the 5th Borders of the 50th Division, the Battalion withdrawing
on relief to billets in Achicourt, which it reached
at 5 a.m. on the 3rd July.</p>

<p>The part of the 56th Division in the Arras fighting was
now finished, and the Division was withdrawn into Corps
reserve for a welcome rest. The fighting on the Hindenburg
line was practically over, though we shall have
further reference to make to it in connection with the
2/4th Battalion in another chapter.</p>

<p>The weeks of battle had placed a great strain on the
Battalion. Long marches to and from the line, shell hole
bivouacs, heavy working parties, bad weather and severe
shelling had all had their effect, and a period of rest and
reorganisation was needed.</p>

<p>At 9.30 a.m. on the 4th July the 168th Brigade embussed
for the Le Cauroy area, in which it had trained a
year previously prior to occupying the Hébuterne trenches.
The Battalion was allotted billets in Denier where it
entered on a short period of rest and reorganisation in
which the training was interspersed with the various
rounds of the Brigade boxing competition, the finals of
which were held on the 15th July.</p>

<p>In June Lieut. H. Jones was seconded to VI Corps
School as Instructor; Capt. V. S. Bowater was evacuated
to hospital; and 2/Lieut. C. W. Denning joined the
Battalion, being posted to the 168th L.T.M. Battery early
in July; 2/Lieuts. L. W. Wreford and A. C. Knight rejoined
the Battalion in July.</p>

<p>The Division was now warned of an impending move
to another theatre of activity, and this move occurred on
the 23rd, when the Division left the VII Corps to join the
Fifth Army in the Ypres Salient.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

THE 2/4TH BATTALION IN THE BATTLES FOR
BULLECOURT, 1917</h2>


<p>We must now follow the battles which had been fought
during the latter part of the German retirement south of
the area covered by the battles of Arras.</p>

<p>All along the line the German retreat had been conducted
steadily and with marked success on to the Hindenburg
line. Although on the whole the retreat in the south
had not been accompanied by heavy fighting, the attempts
of our troops to push forward and define rigidly the
Hindenburg system had met with resistance which had
developed here and there into fighting of the most
desperate character. Nowhere had these local conflagrations
been more fierce than in the line of retreat to
Bullecourt. In this sector the retiring enemy was opposed
by Australian troops, who together with the 7th and 62nd
(and later the 58th) Divisions composed Gough's Fifth
Army.</p>

<p>A successful advance on 2nd April in this region was
followed by an attempt by the Australians on the 12th to
carry the line Bullecourt-Lagnicourt, but without success
owing to the inadequacy of the supporting artillery fire.
Severe fighting ensued, and a counter-attack of a serious
nature by the Germans on the 15th was ultimately held.</p>

<p>On the 3rd May the Australians' efforts met with more
success, and they were able to penetrate the Hindenburg
system on the immediate right of Bullecourt. The 62nd
Division on their left, however, were unable to progress
in the village itself, with the result that the ground held
by the Australians formed a salient badly enfiladed both
from the village and from the direction of Quéant.</p>

<p>The position of Bullecourt in the Hindenburg system
was peculiar. From Heninel the line ran in a generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
south-easterly direction towards Bullecourt in front of the
Fontaine-lez-Croisilles-Bullecourt Road. At Bullecourt the
line turned due east, passing some 500 yards in front
of Riencourt. Bullecourt itself was between the front
and support trenches of the first system, so that the front
line formed a very pronounced salient. East of Riencourt
the line once more took an abrupt turn, this time almost
due south, passing in front (or to the west) of Quéant.</p>

<p>Bullecourt lies on a spur which falls northward into
the Hendecourt valley, and its exits on all sides form a
network of sunken roads. At the period under review the
majority of the houses were already in ruins, and these,
together with numerous fences enclosing orchards and
gardens, converted the space between the front and
support Hindenburg lines into a serious obstacle, of which
the strength was increased by an intermediate trench half-way
through the village. The Germans had, moreover,
tunnelled the village in such a way that they could bring
reinforcements rapidly and safely to bear on any threatened
point. The small salient gained by the Australians
straddling the Hindenburg trenches on the immediate east
of the village, uncomfortable as it was for the occupants,
was a serious menace to the enemy position; and it was
reasonable to anticipate that the Germans would not easily
acquiesce in this partial envelopment of their flank.</p>

<p>During the early days of May the Australians in the
salient were subjected to numerous counter-attacks, while
by dint of hand-to-hand fighting the 62nd Division had
gained a firm footing in the village. On the 12th May
the assault was renewed by the 7th Division, and fighting
of a desperately severe character developed in the village
in which our troops met with varying fortunes. In the
eastern half of the village the 2nd Queen's made some
progress, but at the western end no advance was possible.
The situation at the sunken cross-roads at the north-east
corner of the village was obscure, and north of this point
no part of the enemy's support line was gained. Such
was the position in "Bloody Bullecourt" when the 58th
Division began to take over the line.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 12th May the Company Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>manders
and Intelligence Officer of the 2/4th Battalion,
together with their Platoon Sergeants, were sent forward
to reconnoitre the positions held by the 15th Australian
Infantry Brigade with a view to taking them over. From
Vaulx-Vraucourt to Noreuil the party followed the dried-up
bed of the Hirondelle River, the scene of many a
desperate struggle during the preceding month. The air
was oppressive with the heat of a premature burst of
summer weather; the stench from hundreds of unburied
bodies and the ominous silence of the guns prior to the
attack which was to be renewed the following day caused
the whole atmosphere to be heavy with the presage of
hard fighting to come. On arrival at the Australian
Headquarters the party was informed of the attack
organised for the following morning, so that further
reconnaissance that day was useless. After the barrage
had died down, however, on the 13th a fresh start was
made up the communication trench, which was really
the Noreuil-Riencourt Road, a bank on the east side
preventing observation from Quéant.</p>

<p>The Australian attack was successful, although the
position was not entirely cleared up, and they were now
holding the first two lines of the Hindenburg system, the
support line being our front line, and the former front
line now forming our support. The intense artillery fire
to which this ground had many times been subjected had
resulted in the almost total obliteration of the trench
lines as such, and the position was really held in a line
of shell craters.</p>

<p>The arrangements for relief being completed, the 2/4th
Battalion moved up on the night of the 13th/14th May to
take over the left sector of the Brigade front, from the
sunken cross-roads at the north-east corner of Bullecourt
to a small communication trench about 500 yards to the
east, C Company (Leake) and D Company (Parker) being
in the front line with A (Cotton) and B (Bottomley)
in support. Battalion Headquarters occupied a central
position in the support line. A detached post under
2/Lieut. S. A. Seys was established in a shell hole west of
the sunken cross-roads in order to secure touch with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
7th Division in the village. From the right of the 2/4th
Battalion the Brigade sector as far as the Noreuil-Riencourt
Road was taken up by the 2/3rd Londons.</p>

<p>The actual process of the relief, which was not completed
until 1.30 a.m. on the 14th May, was exceedingly
trying owing to the heavy shelling of the communication
trench. Amongst the casualties caused by this were
2/Lieut. F. Stickney (wounded) and Capt. P. H. Burton,
R.A.M.C. (killed).</p>

<p>The Germans, having been ejected from their trench
system in this sector, were holding on in a system of unconnected
shell holes on the lower slopes of the spur, and
their main line of resistance appeared to be a sunken
road running laterally across our front, and distant about
300 yards. A new and evidently unfinished trench line
crossed the opposite hillside in front of Hendecourt.</p>

<p>The heavy shelling which had interfered with the
relief continued throughout the night, our front and
support lines being heavily bombarded, while the back
areas were subjected to incessant searching with high
explosive and shrapnel.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Battalion had taken up its position
a party of some 12 Germans with a machine-gun attempted
to attack C Company's line. The attack completely failed
owing principally to the great gallantry of Capt. Leake.
2/Lieut. S. G. Askham, who was in the trench with Leake
at the time, writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We were inspecting the sentry posts and our attention
was drawn to considerable movement near our front line.
Without a moment's hesitation Capt. Leake leapt over
the parapet and in a few seconds we heard revolver shots
being fired. He had single-handed attacked a German
machine-gun team who were on the point of establishing
a post in a position overlooking the whole of our front
line. He killed four of the team and the remainder
were wounded by our rifle fire. Leake returned with
three prisoners and their machine-gun, which he also
secured.... Leake was a tower of strength to both
officers and men in the Company and we all felt that he
richly deserved the V.C., for which he was afterwards
recommended.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>The continued bombardment now began to cause
difficulty in controlling the situation, for early in the
morning a direct hit on the Brigade signal depôt
completely wrecked all the instruments and killed the
occupants of the dugout. Later, communication by power
buzzer was also cut, and for the remainder of the day all
communication between the Brigade and the battalions
in the line had to be effected by runners.</p>

<p>This intermittent shelling continued until shortly after
midday on the 14th, when the enemy was observed from
our lines to be massing for attack in the neighbourhood
of a ruined factory some 500 yards to our front. A call
was made on our artillery, which immediately put down
a heavy barrage under which the enemy's troops melted
away. The hostile bombardment now increased in intensity
and a terrific barrage came down on our lines,
continuing with unabated violence all through the night.
This barrage was for the greater part in enfilade from
the direction of Quéant, and was therefore particularly
accurate and deadly; under the rain of shells our
trenches, or what little remained of them, were completely
obliterated, the greater part of our front line supplies of
rifle ammunition and bombs were blown up and several
Lewis guns with their teams were buried. Through this
appalling ordeal the Battalion stuck to their posts grimly,
though suffering severe losses. Shortly before midnight
the enemy launched an attack on the 7th Division in
Bullecourt village, in which by dint of fierce hand-to-hand
conflicts they wrested from the 7th Division some of its
gains of the previous two days.</p>

<p>We have already pointed to the importance of the
salient now occupied by the 2/4th Londons, and, fully
alive to the position, the Battalion was not surprised by
the attack which broke upon it at dawn the next day.
The importance to the Germans of the possession of this
part of the line may be gauged by the fact that the troops
employed by them were the 3rd Prussian Guard.</p>

<p>At 4 a.m. on the 15th the enemy were seen to be
massing for the attack. Our artillery once more responded
magnificently to the call made on them, and their barrage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
caused severe disorganisation in the enemy's ranks. The
attack was stubbornly pushed home by the Germans, but
their barrage being lifted prematurely from our front line
an opportunity was afforded to our leading companies to
prepare for the shock. Advantage of this momentary
respite was taken to reinforce the front line, three platoons
of B Company filling the gaps of D Company, and C Company
being strengthened by a party of A Company. These
precautions cost the enemy dearly, and his assaulting
columns were met by a deadly rifle and Lewis gun fire
from the whole of our line, which completed the work of
the artillery. The German attack was broken and not a
single enemy reached our line. The remnants of the
assaulting battalions turned and fled down the hill, leaving
an appalling number of dead and wounded.</p>

<p>Beyond the right of the Brigade front a small party
succeeded in effecting a lodgment in a portion of the front
line held by the Australians, but these were shortly afterwards
ejected with the assistance of a platoon of the
2/2nd Londons.</p>

<p>By six o'clock the enemy counter-attack was definitely
and finally broken and small parties could be seen
doubling away from before Bullecourt; and a further
attempt to launch an attack on the Australians about
half an hour later was effectively stopped by our artillery.</p>

<p>After the attack had failed the enemy settled down
to a slow but steady shelling of our line for the remainder
of the 15th, which was spent in endeavouring to reorganise
the battered remnants of the Battalion and to put the
lines once more in a defensible condition. Under cover
of darkness the 2/1st Londons took over the left subsector
from the 2/4th Londons, which withdrew to reserve dugouts
in the sunken road in front of Noreuil.</p>

<p>The Battalion had found itself. In its first serious
action it had stood up to a frightful bombardment which
had lasted without abatement for nineteen hours, and at
the end of it had seen the backs of the Prussian Guard.
It had paid, however, a severe price. The total casualties
during the two days in the line were, in officers, in addition
to the two already mentioned, 2/Lieuts. E. C. Pratt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
T. Stoaling (killed); Capts. G. E. A. Leake and H. C.
Long (wounded); and in N.C.O.'s and men 68 killed,
196 wounded and 2 missing.</p>

<p>Capt. Leake had behaved with the utmost gallantry
throughout the attack. He was hit after the attack itself
was over by a shell which fell on his Company Headquarters,
wounding also his second in command, Capt.
Long, and several of his Company staff. While being
conveyed on a stretcher to the Aid Post, Leake was again
severely hit by a shell which burst almost under the
stretcher, killing two of the bearers. After the shelling
had subsided he was evacuated, but died in hospital a
fortnight later. For his magnificent behaviour he was
recommended by Lieut.-Col. Dann for the Victoria Cross,
and eventually was awarded the D.S.O. a few days before
his death. This was conferred on him by Gen. Gough,
who visited for the express purpose the C.C.S. in which
Leake was lying. Lieut.-Col. Dann was awarded the
D.S.O. for his excellent work in this action. Awards of
the Military Medal were made to L./Corpls. Spencer and
Selby, and Ptes. Grierson, Olinski and Spence.</p>

<p>For three days the Battalion remained in the sunken
road supplying carrying parties to the front line. The
destruction caused by the hostile bombardment was such
that all the necessary trench supplies in munitions and
material had to be completely renewed, and, moreover,
the battalion in the line was dependent on its supporting
troops for their water supply. This imposed a very heavy
strain on the 2/4th Battalion for the back areas were still
continuously shelled, largely with gas shell, and particularly
during the hours of darkness when the carrying parties
were at work; and the relief of the 173rd Brigade by the
175th which ensued on the night of the 18th/19th May
was welcome.</p>

<p>That night at 11 p.m. the Battalion handed over to the
2/12th Londons (175th Brigade) and marched to rest
billets in Bihucourt, where it remained until the 29th,
engaged in reorganisation and refitting and training.
During this period the gaps in the Battalion were partly
filled by reinforcements of two officers, 2/Lieuts. J. H. L.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
Wheatley and E. P. Higgs, and a large draft of N.C.O.'s
and men. The 2/4th Londons were visited on the
20th May by Lieut.-Gen. Birdwood, commanding the
Australians, who congratulated Lieut.-Col. Dann on the
Battalion's achievement.</p>

<p>During the latter half of May the 58th Division extended
its left flank, taking over in succession from the
7th and 62nd Divisions both of which had suffered severely.
By the end of the month the Division was occupying a
front of 4000 yards with two brigades in line. The 173rd
Brigade took over the left subsector with the 2/1st and
2/2nd Londons in line, and the 2/3rd Londons in close
support, while the 2/4th Londons moved on the 31st
May in Brigade reserve to Mory, where they continued
training.</p>

<p>Map No. 11 shows the position at this date. It will
be seen that north-west of Bullecourt the Hindenburg line
on the Divisional front was still not captured, though on
its left the 21st Division was in possession of the front
trench as far as the Croisilles-Fontaine Road. The 58th
Division sector consisted for the greater part of isolated
shell hole defences.</p>

<p>There thus remained in this area a length of about
2500 yards of Hindenburg front and about 3500 yards
of Hindenburg support trench still to be captured from
the enemy in order to complete the allotted task.</p>

<p>The first two days in the new sector passed without
incident beyond the usual artillery activity. Early on
the morning of the 3rd June a gas attack was carried out
on the enemy's lines opposite our left by a discharge of
197 gas projectors. The gas cloud formed appeared highly
satisfactory, and evidently caused the enemy some perturbation
as his artillery promptly put a barrage on our
forward posts. This, however, inflicted but little loss
owing to the previous withdrawal of the garrisons as a
precautionary measure.</p>

<p>Various signs of nervousness exhibited by the enemy
about this time suggested that he expected the continuance
of our offensive, and indeed in view of the successes
already gained he might with reason anticipate that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
would not be left in unmolested possession of the remaining
sectors of the Hindenburg system.</p>

<p>On the night of the 3rd/4th June the 2/4th Londons
relieved the 2/2nd Londons in the left subsector, A and B
Companies (Cotton and Bottomley) occupying the forward
posts with C and D Companies (Hewlett and Parker) in
support. The line opposed to the Battalion was entirely
in front of the Heninel-Bullecourt Road, with a support
line about 200 yards in rear of it. For the greater part
the line ran straight, but two small salients, the Knuckle
and the Hump, had been developed into strong points
of no mean order. The whole line was heavily wired, and
although the entanglements had suffered from our shell
fire they still presented a formidable obstacle, while the
patrols sent forward nightly from our posts obtained clear
evidence that the line was held in unusual strength.</p>

<p>The most urgent work in this sector was the linking
up of our scattered shell hole posts to form a connected
line, and this was pushed on with all possible speed and
completed by the night of the 10th. Throughout this
tour of duty the enemy continued a fairly vigorous
bombardment of our trenches and back areas, which was
returned with interest by our artillery.</p>

<p>On the night of the 11th/12th June the 2/1st Londons
took over from A, B and D Companies, while C Company
was relieved by the 2/7th Londons (174th Brigade). On
relief the Battalion withdrew in support to St Leger,
where Headquarters opened at the Château.</p>

<p>During the days spent in support the Battalion was
reinforced by a large draft of N.C.O.'s and men, and by
two officers, 2/Lieuts. C. Potter and V. R. Oldrey. The
latter officer was most unfortunately hit by a stray bullet
on the following day.</p>

<p>The principal duty of the three days following relief
was the organisation and special training of A, B and
D Companies to take part in an assault of the Hindenburg
system opposite the Brigade front.</p>

<p>The front of attack extended from the sharp corner
just south of the Knuckle on the right to a point about
150 yards north of the Hump on the left. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
proposed operation included the capture of two lines of
trench it was decided by Corps to divide it into two days'
work in order to simplify the question of the co-operation
of the 21st Division on the left. Accordingly the plan was
that the first day the 173rd Brigade should capture the
allotted portion of the front line, while the second day
the area of operations should be extended and the 21st
Division on the left should join with the 173rd Brigade
in the assault of the support line.</p>

<p>The troops detailed for the attack were in order from
right to left, 1 company 2/3rd, 1 company 2/1st, 1½ companies
2/2nd and 1 company 2/4th Londons. For the
purposes of the operation the companies of the 2/3rd and
2/4th Londons were respectively under command of the
officers commanding 2/1st and 2/2nd Londons. The
attack was to be delivered under a heavy barrage from
a strong concentration of guns of the 7th, 58th and
62nd Divisions and the Corps Heavy Artillery, together
with the massed guns of the three Brigade Machine-Gun
Companies. Arrangements were also made for the
provision of supporting rifle, Lewis gun and machine-gun
fire by the 21st Division.</p>

<p>The 174th Brigade was to arrange for the establishment
of a line of posts along the sunken road in
prolongation to the right of the 173rd Brigade's objective.</p>

<p>A Company (Cotton) was detailed for the first day's
attack, and the special task allotted to it by Lieut.-Col.
Richardson, commanding the 2/2nd Battalion, was the
capture of the sunken cross-roads to the left of the Hump
and of a German strong point in the front line about
100 yards north of them.</p>

<p>The assembly was successfully carried out during the
night of 14th/15th June, and completed by about 2.15 a.m.
At 2.50 a.m. our barrage opened and the assaulting waves
moved forward to the attack in good order, keeping well
up to the barrage and suffering very little loss.</p>

<p>The attack proved successful though it led to some
hard fighting. The actual advance was entrusted to two
platoons under 2/Lieut. Wheatley (right) and 2/Lieut. Bell
(left). The objective at this point was strengthened by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
two "pillbox" machine-gun posts and was in line with
the trench already held on our left by the 21st Division,
from which it was divided by a double barricade; and
Lieut.-Col. Richardson took up his Battle Headquarters in
a dugout in their line, as did also Capt. Cotton. A third
platoon of A Company under 2/Lieut. Boorman assembled
in the 21st Division trench, and was formed as a bombing
party with others to rush the double barricade at zero hour
and to bomb the enemy out of their two pillboxes before
our barrage had lifted off the enemy trench in order to
clear it before the arrival of Bell and Wheatley with
their platoons. A good many casualties were therefore
inevitably caused to Boorman's platoon by our own shell
fire, and he reached the traverse next to the first pillbox
with only two corporals, Sherwood and Whitworth. Here
the two N.C.O.'s threw bombs, which landed neatly
outside the two doors of the pillbox, and directly they
exploded Boorman dashed round the traverse with a
bomb in each hand. Sheltering himself against the wall,
he threw his bombs into each door of the pillbox before
the Germans inside had recovered from the effects of
Sherwood and Whitworth's attack. This neat piece of
work secured the pillbox to us, but before Boorman could
reorganise his party for the further advance to the second
pillbox Bell's platoon had occupied the trench. A few
men of Wheatley's platoon were also found to be in
line. The greater number, including Wheatley himself,
apparently overshot the objective, not recognising it in
its battered condition, and must all have been killed or
captured.</p>

<p>According to the prearranged scheme, Bell's platoon
was withdrawn shortly before dawn, and Boorman was
left in charge of the captured position with the remains
of his own and Wheatley's platoons. The 2/2nd Londons
were now in touch on our right, and by arrangement with
them the trench was divided between the two Battalions,
the 2/4th Londons being responsible from the 21st Division
on the left as far as the communication trench running
back from the Hump to the German support line. The
shelling now resumed more moderate proportions, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
it continued sporadically all day, and casualties were continually
being caused in our ranks. The Battalion suffered
a severe loss early in the day in Sergt. Riley, who was
acting C.S.M. for the attack. He had done very good
work indeed ever since the Battalion had been in France,
and had throughout shown complete indifference to
danger. He was shot through the chest while accompanying
Boorman on a reconnaissance to endeavour to
trace Wheatley's missing platoon.</p>

<p>In the meantime arrangements had been made for
the further attack on the support Hindenburg line on
the following morning, and detailed orders had been
issued which provided for the assembly of the assaulting
troops in the front line&mdash;the first day's objective&mdash;by
2.10 a.m. on the 16th June. This intention could not,
however, be carried out, for at about 10.30 p.m. on the
15th a heavy counter-attack was launched against our
new positions which caused severe fighting, in the course
of which the enemy once more gained a hold on the centre
of his old front line and also at two other points.</p>

<p>On the front held by the 2/4th Londons the counter-offensive
took the form of a bombing attack, the approach
of which along the communication trench opposite the
right of our sector was disclosed by the enemy's own star
shells, which rendered plainly visible the forms of the
attackers waist high above the battered sides of the
trench. A shower of Véry lights was at once put up, and
with the assistance of these the attack was driven off by
Lewis gun and rifle grenade fire, arrangements for which
had been made most skilfully by Boorman earlier in the
day. None of the enemy succeeded in penetrating our
position, but many of his dead were left on the ground.</p>

<p>It was, however, so essential to our purpose that the
enemy should not have the advantage of a day's respite
before the attack on the support line, that immediate
arrangements were made for a counter-attack to eject
him once more from his old front line in order to leave
this clear as our jumping-off point. The recapture of the
line was entrusted to the 2/1st and 2/3rd Londons, who
succeeded by surprise in completely recovering the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
of the front line at the point of the bayonet by 2.45 a.m.
on the 16th.</p>

<p>At 3.10 a.m. the second day's attack opened. The
order of battle was the same as for the first day, but the
forces employed were larger, the 2/3rd Londons supplying
three companies, the 2/1st Londons three companies,
the 2/2nd Londons two companies and the 2/4th Londons
two companies (B under Bottomley and D under Parker).</p>

<p>The attack, as for the first day, was made under a
creeping barrage supplied by the Divisional artillery and
the Brigade machine-gun companies, and the assault was
made in one wave with a "mopping-up" wave in rear
accompanied by a detachment of Royal Engineers for
consolidation work.</p>

<p>This day again a good deal of difficulty seems to have
been experienced by the advancing troops in identifying
their objectives, which had become almost entirely
obliterated by our long-continued bombardments, while
the dust raised by the barrage rendered the recognition of
surrounding physical features almost impossible. The resistance
of the enemy all along the line was most stubborn,
and the unusual strength in which he was holding the
attacked position clearly indicated that the attack was
expected. The earliest reports which were received by
runner led to the belief that the objective on the two
flanks had been captured. No information from the
centre was forthcoming, and it gradually became evident
that the direction of the flank companies was at fault,
with the result that they had swung outwards leaving
in the centre a gap still occupied by the Germans, who
promptly began to bomb along the line against our unprotected
flanks. The attack of the 21st Division on the
left, moreover, failed throughout, and although a few
isolated parties succeeded in reaching a line of shell holes
in front of Tunnel Trench they were eventually forced
to withdraw.</p>

<p>The orders issued to the assaulting wave were to capture
the Hindenburg support line and hold on to it until supports
should reach them, but all the attempts of Lieut.-Col.
Richardson to push forward his supporting troops were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
frustrated by the intense rifle and machine-gun fire with
which the ground was continuously swept, and similar
efforts along the remainder of the front were stopped for
the same reason.</p>

<p>At 11 a.m. the obscurity of the position induced the
Brigadier to make a personal reconnaissance in order, if
possible, to clear up the situation, but he found it
impossible to get along the captured German front line,
and therefore proceeded to the Battle Headquarters of
the 2/2nd Londons. The information obtained there led
to the belief that the 2/2nd and 2/4th Londons had carried
their objectives without difficulty and at comparatively
little loss, but that their flanks were in the air and in
danger of being turned by the bombing attacks of the
enemy. The support line was now entirely cut off as
runner communication was utterly impossible under the
enemy's devastating fire, and it was clear that our isolated
parties who were in the objective must be suffering heavy
losses.</p>

<p>It has been difficult to establish what happened to the
two companies of the 2/4th Battalion owing to the heavy
casualties sustained, but it is evident that they also mistook
the objective and pushed on some 200 yards ahead
of it, where they came under intense fire from front and
flanks.</p>

<p>The most advanced party appears to have been a
platoon of B Company under McDowell, who although
completely out of touch with the remainder of their company
held on most gallantly to the position they had
gained for some two hours, at the end of which time their
ammunition was exhausted and they were using a captured
German machine-gun. No sign of the promised supports
being visible, and the enemy evidently being about to
surround his little party, now reduced to a mere half-dozen,
McDowell determined to fight his way back to his
comrades, and began to withdraw steadily. During his
withdrawal he was hit, and on regaining consciousness
found himself alone. He continued his way back to our
lines, crawling from shell hole to shell hole, and managed
to collect four privates, all resolved to sell their lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
dearly. By this time he was completely surrounded, and
his little band was destroyed by rifle grenade fire;
McDowell himself was hit again and captured. To the
eternal shame of the enemy let it be recorded that he lay
for three days in the enemy trench before being sent to
their dressing-station, and not until six days after his
wounds were received were they dressed at all.</p>

<p>A similar fate appears to have overtaken the remainder
of B and D Companies, and the probability is that having
overshot their objective they were outflanked and cut
off by parties of the enemy coming down the sunken
road from Fontaine-lez-Croisilles. Their mistake having
become evident to them, they endeavoured, like McDowell,
to fight their way back, but after making a gallant stand
were eventually killed or taken prisoners almost to a man.
It is believed from aeroplane reports subsequently received
that this gallant little body actually succeeded in maintaining
themselves against all attacks for nearly two days.
But all efforts to relieve them meeting with failure, they
at last fell gloriously rather than surrender.</p>

<p>A similar lack of success attended the efforts of the
other battalions, and as a result of the two days' fighting
the Brigade held the front Hindenburg line and the sunken
road in rear of it, from the junction with the 21st Division
on the left to a point some 300 yards west of the Crucifix
cross-roads at Bullecourt.</p>

<p>The casualties of the Brigade amounted to 48 officers
and 955 other ranks, those of the 2/4th Battalion for the
two days' fighting being:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Capts. E. W. Bottomley and W. H. Parker, 2/Lieuts. S. M.
Williams and J. H. L. Wheatley, killed; Capt. E. N. Cotton
and 2/Lieut. T. J. Bell, wounded; 2/Lieuts. E. A. Monkman
and R. McDowell, wounded and missing, and 2/Lieut.
E. A. Stevenson, missing.</p>

<p>In N.C.O.'s and men the losses totalled 7 killed, 53 wounded
and 139 missing, the majority being in B and D Companies.</p></div>

<p>It became evident during the afternoon that the 173rd
Brigade, who were weak before they went into action,
would need relief that night, and arrangements were
therefore made for the 174th Brigade to take over the
line. In accordance with this arrangement the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
Brigade front was taken over on the night 16th/17th June
by the 2/5th Londons, who pushed forward strong patrols
towards the Hindenburg support line. This, however, was
found to be held in strength by the enemy.</p>

<p>With this somewhat disastrous day the idea of immediate
further offensive operations was postponed, and
the 174th Brigade settled down to consolidate itself in
the Hindenburg front line.</p>

<p>The fighting spirit displayed throughout the operation
was splendid, and it is only to be regretted that the two
days' work had not been arranged for a one day battle.
As the event showed, the capture of the Hindenburg
front line on the 15th prepared the enemy for our attempt
to take the support line on the 16th, with the result that
on the second day severe casualties were inflicted on our
troops to no purpose.</p>

<p>During the second action at Bullecourt an incident
occurred which is surely one of the most remarkable of
the whole War. We recount it in the words of the official
record, which appeared in the Battalion War Diary on
the 8th August:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No. 282496 Pte. Taylor J., of A Company, admitted
to 29th C.C.S. This man had been missing since Bullecourt
on the 15th June 1917, had been wounded and
crawled into a shell hole. He sustained a compound
fracture of the left thigh, and aided by Pte. Peters,
B Company, had lived on bully beef found on the bodies
of dead men. After being in the shell hole for over six
weeks Pte. Peters apparently was captured, for the
following day three Germans visited the shell hole and
shook Pte. Taylor's leg, but he feigned death. The following
day, not being able to obtain any food, he decided
to crawl back to our lines. His position was some distance
behind the German line. He dragged himself to the
parapet of the trench, threw himself over, crawled through
the wire across No Man's Land into the sector held by the
S. Staffords. Altogether he spent seven weeks and four
days behind the German lines.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_b_288fp.jpg" width="500" height="337" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Bullecourt, May-June, 1917</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>Pte. Taylor's story was subjected to severe scrutiny by
Lieut.-Col. Dann and by the Brigadier, and their opinion
of its truth is witnessed by the fact that he was awarded
the D.C. Medal. Pte. Peters' fate is unknown, and it is
regrettable that after his devotion to his comrade it was
not possible to make him a posthumous award for his
gallantry.</p>

<p>On relief by the 2/5th Londons the 2/4th Battalion
marched to Divisional reserve camp in Mory Copse, where
it remained for four days in reorganising and training.
The month at Bullecourt had cost the Battalion 597
casualties in all ranks, and a rest after the prolonged
operations was urgently needed.</p>

<p>B and D Companies were for the moment practically
effaced, and the few remaining details were therefore
attached respectively to A and C Companies, these two
composite companies being placed under command of
Capts. E. N. Cotton and H. A. T. Hewlett.</p>

<p>On the 24th June the 58th Division was finally withdrawn
from Bullecourt, its place being taken by the
7th Division, and Divisional Headquarters opened at
Courcelles on that day.</p>

<p>The 2/4th Londons with the remainder of the 173rd
Brigade had moved on the 21st to Camp at Logeast Wood,
where a welcome fifteen days' rest was spent in training
and reorganising, working parties being supplied daily to
the R.E. dump at Achiet-le-Grand.</p>

<p>During this period awards were made of the
Military Cross to 2/Lieut. D. S. Boorman, and of the
Military Medal to L.-Corpl. Coates, for their gallant conduct
on the 15th/16th June. The Battalion was joined on the
24th June by Capt. W. A. Stark and 2/Lieut. S. Davis,
and by drafts of 107 other ranks on the 21st June and
of 28 N.C.O.'s on the 4th July. This welcome accession
of strength, especially in N.C.O.'s, who had become very
few, rendered it possible once more to reorganise the
Battalion in four companies under Capts. E. N. Cotton (A),
G. H. Hetley (B), H. A. T. Hewlett (C), and A. G. Croll (D).
The duties of Intelligence Officer were taken over from
Capt. Croll by 2/Lieut. S. A. Seys, and on the 12th July,
Cotton having been evacuated to hospital, command of
A Company was assumed by Capt. D. S. Boorman, M.C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>The period of rest at Logeast Wood was brought to a
close by a Battalion sports meeting, one of those quite
informal but very keenly followed affairs which always
have proved such an invaluable means of recuperation
for tired troops. The following day the reorganised
Battalion was inspected by the Colonel, and on the
8th July the Battalion marched through the devastated
region and the ruins of Courcelles, Sapignies and Bapaume
to Bancourt. Its route continued the following day to
Ytres, where six days in billets were occupied in parading
for inspection successively by the Divisional General
(Fanshawe), the Brigadier (Freyberg) and the IV Corps
Commander.</p>

<p>The Brigade was now in Divisional reserve, the Division
having taken over a sector of line in front of Gouzeaucourt
and Havrincourt Wood. The British trenches here were
opposed once more to the Hindenburg system, which
had not been penetrated in this region. After severe
fighting in April round Epéhy our troops had established
themselves on high ground on the line Villers Plouich-Beaucamp-Trescault,
whence a series of spurs descend
gradually in a north-easterly direction towards Ribemont,
Marcoing and the Scheldt Canal&mdash;all destined to
witness bitter fighting in the Cambrai battle five months
later.</p>

<p>The Gouzeaucourt-Havrincourt Wood sector was now
exceedingly quiet. This, to an extent, was of great
advantage to the Battalion, since nearly 40 per cent. of
its strength at the moment consisted of drafts newly
arrived who had not yet been under fire. It was possible,
therefore, for the new material to become properly
assimilated into the Battalion before further casualties
created deficiencies in the ranks.</p>

<p>On the night 16th/17th July the 173rd Brigade took
over from the 174th Brigade the right of the Divisional
front from the neighbourhood of Villers Plouich to Queens
Lane, a communication trench 500 yards west of the
Beaucamp-Ribemont Road.</p>

<p>The 2/4th Battalion remained in Brigade reserve for
a few days, Battalion Headquarters and A Company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
being in huts in Dessart Wood, C and D Companies in
Gouzeaucourt Wood, and B Company attached to the
2/1st Battalion in a support trench south of Beaucamp.
Daily working parties were supplied by the Battalion for
trench repair and improvement work, but very little
incident worthy of record occurred. The principal excitement
was provided by the intelligence that a German
spy disguised as an officer of the R.F.A. was in hiding
in one of the numerous woods with which the countryside
is dotted, but the Battalion was not successful in tracking
him down.</p>

<p>The only portion of the line in which there was any
degree of activity was in front of the left of the Brigade
sector, where an isolated spinney in the middle of No
Man's Land&mdash;here some 600 to 700 yards wide&mdash;was
always a target for the enemy's artillery. This spinney,
known as Boar Copse, was occupied by the Battalion in
the line as an advanced post, and it was decided to wire
round the edge of the Copse and connect it to our front
line by a communication trench. The duty of executing
the work fell to the 2/4th Londons, and a working party
of 4 officers and 180 N.C.O.'s and men was supplied under
Capt. A. G. Croll on the night 20th/21st July. As ill
luck would have it, the Germans selected this same evening
to endeavour to raid the outpost line occupied by the
2/9th Londons farther to the left. The raid was carried
out under an intense barrage, but our artillery answered
promptly to the call made on it and the raiders were
beaten off, leaving a prisoner in our hands. Unfortunately
the raid caused a certain amount of shelling on the Boar
Copse front resulting in a few casualties, among whom
was Capt. Croll. This was exceedingly bad luck and a
loss to the Battalion. Croll had done excellent work
since the arrival in France of the 2/4th Battalion and
had just received his company. His wound, though not
dangerous, was sufficiently severe to keep him in England
for almost a year. His company was taken over by
Capt. C. A. Clarke.</p>

<p>The following night the Battalion relieved the 2/3rd
Battalion in the right subsector on a front of about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
1500 yards, all the companies being in line and each
providing its own supports.</p>

<p>The trenches were well sited and well dug, being
very deep and heavily traversed. Throughout this area
the communication trenches were of exceptional length,
Lincoln Lane in particular, which ran from Gouzeaucourt
Wood to Beaucamp, being over two miles long.</p>

<p>Very little incident occurred during this tour of duty.
No Man's Land was patrolled nightly and appeared to
belong to us as no enemy were encountered.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 30th July the Battalion was
relieved by the 11th Royal Scots and marched to the
light railway at Dessart Wood, whence it entrained to
Neuville-Borjonval, camping there for the night.</p>

<p>The following day the Battalion moved by bus from
Neuville to Izel-les-Hameau, in the Arras area, the transport
under Major Nunneley moving by train from Bapaume
to Saulty and then by march route to Hameau.</p>

<p>The whole Division was now put through a regular
course of re-equipment and training in preparation for
the heavy work it was to be called upon to do in the
offensive at Ypres. In this training particular attention
was paid to musketry, the necessity for this having been
clearly demonstrated in all recent actions, in which troops
had shown a tendency to use bombs or rifle grenades to
the exclusion of their rifles.</p>

<p>During this period drafts of officers were received as
follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent8">

<p>6th July&mdash;2/Lieut. F. A. Carlisle.</p>

<p>20th July&mdash;Lieut. F. S. Marsh (7th Londons); 2/Lieuts. R.
Michell (6th Londons); and H. N. Bundle,
W. F. Vines, E. R. Seabury and C. C. H.
Clifford (13th Londons).</p>

<p>25th July&mdash;Lieut. D. C. Cooke; 2/Lieuts. F. B. Burd and A. J.
Angel (13th Londons).</p>

<p>1st August&mdash;2/Lieuts. J. McDonald and F. W. Walker; 2/Lieut.
C. S. Pike (7th Londons).</p>

<p>9th August&mdash;2/Lieut. A. S. Cook (7th Londons).</p></div>

<p>The Battalion changed its quarters on the 13th August,
leaving Izel for Denier, where it proceeded with its training.
Not all the time was devoted to work, but some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
excellent sports meetings were held&mdash;and at the Brigade
Sports on the 20th the Battalion was successful in winning
the Cup presented by Brig.-Gen. B. C. Freyberg, V.C.,
D.S.O. The importance of achievements of this nature
cannot be over-rated. The longer the War continued the
more obvious it became that if "rest" periods were to
do any good to the men at all they must be periods of
mental as well as physical rest, and games of all sorts
provide the required relaxation more than anything else.
On coming out of the trenches, weary, muddy, possibly
hungry, and almost certainly wet through, the men's first
moments of freedom were spent in a game of football.</p>

<p>This was an aspect of the mentality of the
British soldier which we believe was never fathomed by
the French villagers. Their hospitality and devotion to
"les braves Tommys" was unfailing and genuine; but
we feel there was a lingering notion among our kind hosts
that this remarkable devotion to football was really a
confirmation of the time-honoured tradition that the
English are all at least a little mad.</p>

<p>Reinforcements of N.C.O.'s and men were also being
fed into the Battalion during this period, and by the end
of August the strength in N.C.O.'s and men had increased
by about 240.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

THE THIRD BATTLE OF YPRES</h2>


<h3>I. <em>The 1/4th Battalion on the Menin Road</em></h3>

<p>By the middle of May 1917 the British efforts on the
Arras front had achieved the success which had been
aimed at; and the offensive having been sufficiently
prolonged to assist the French in their operations on the
Chemin des Dames, the Commander-in-Chief was free to
turn his attention to the northern area of the British
lines.</p>

<p>The first phase of the operation was opened on the
7th June, when a brilliant attack by the Second Army
(Plumer) carried the British line forward over the Messines
and Wytschaete Ridges, from which the Germans had
dominated our positions since October 1914. This operation,
which was one of the most completely successful
of the whole War, resulted by the 14th June in the
advancement of practically the whole Second Army front
from the River Warnave to Klein Zillebeeke.</p>

<p>One by one the points of vantage held by the enemy
since the beginning of siege warfare were being wrested
from his grasp. In succession the Thiepval Ridge, the
Bucquoy Ridge, the Vimy Ridge and finally the Messines-Wytschaete
Ridge had fallen into our hands, and there
remained of this long series of heights only the series of
ridges which from Zillebeeke to Passchendaele dominate
Ypres on the east and north sides. It was towards these
hills that the British offensive efforts were now directed.</p>

<p>The opening day of the offensive had originally been
fixed for the 25th July 1917, but owing to the intensity
of our bombardment the enemy in anticipation of attack
had withdrawn his guns, and the attack was therefore
postponed in order that the British guns might be corre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>spondingly
advanced. Combined with the systematic
bombardment of the enemy's trenches, strong points and
communications, a definite air offensive which ensured
our local supremacy in this respect, and also severe gas
shelling, were undertaken.</p>

<p>The front of attack extended for some fifteen miles
from Deulemont on the right to Boesinghe on the Yser
Canal&mdash;the main attack being entrusted to the Fifth
Army (Gough) on a front of about seven miles from the
Zillebeeke-Zandvoorde Road to Boesinghe. The Second
Army on the right was to make only a limited advance
with the chief objects of widening the front of attack and
distributing the enemy's resistance. At the same time
the French on the extreme left (or north) would co-operate
in the marshes of the Yser.</p>

<p>The offensive was finally launched on the 31st July
1917. The weather, which for a fortnight previously had
been fine and dry and had seemed to predict success,
broke on the day of the battle, and a merciless rain
which changed the whole area of operations to a sea
of mud fell without cessation for several days. The Corps
in line on the 31st July were from left to right the XIV
(Cavan), the XVIII (Maxse), the XIX (Watts), the II
(Jacob) and the X (Morland). On the whole the day
was one of marked success, the deepest advance being
made in the northern sector of the attack. From Westhoek
to St Julien the second German line was carried,
while north of the latter village the assaulting troops
passed the second line and gained the line of the Steenbeek
as far as the junction with the French, whose attack had
also met with complete success. South of Westhoek the
enemy's resistance had been more stubborn, and his positions
in Inverness Copse and Glencorse Wood which were
strongly held by machine-gun posts proved an impassable
obstacle. In this region, however, the German first line
was carried, and our troops managed to maintain themselves
far enough forward on the Westhoek Ridge to deny
the enemy observation over the Ypres plain; the position
gained running almost due south from Westhoek east
of the line Clapham Junction&mdash;Stirling Castle&mdash;Bodmin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
Copse, and thence to Shrewsbury Forest, south of which
the German second line was occupied as far as the Ypres-Comines
Canal. South of the Canal also the Second Army
achieved considerable success.</p>

<p>The rain, which began to fall in the afternoon, had a
most disastrous effect on the British plan of attack.
Movement over the shell-torn ground, which was transformed
into a series of bogs, rapidly became impossible
apart from a few well-defined tracks, and these naturally
became marks for the enemy's guns. The labour of
moving forward guns, relieving troops and completing
the forward dumps and other preparations for the next
bound was increased tenfold. The inevitable delay which
ensued was of the greatest service to the enemy, who
thereby gained a valuable respite in which he was able
to bring up reinforcements.</p>

<p>The fighting of the next few days was, therefore, local
in character and consisted in clearing up the situation
and improving the British positions at various points in
the line, in the course of which operations the capture of
Westhoek was completed. Numerous counter-attacks by
the enemy were successfully resisted, and the line gained
on the 31st July was substantially held.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The 56th Division moved from the Third Army area
on the 24th July to the St Omer area. The 1/4th Londons
entrained at Petit Houvin for St Omer and marched to
billets at Houlle, in the Eperlecques area, some five miles
north-west of St Omer. The Division was now attached
to the V Corps. Its training was continued during the
opening phase of the battle, after which the Division
moved on the 6th August to the II Corps area, the
Battalion occupying billets at Steenvoorde, where the
routine was resumed. On the 8th Major-Gen. D. Smith,
C.B. (who had commanded the Division since 24th
July, when Gen. Hull fell sick), left to command
the 20th Division and, two days later, command was
assumed by Major-Gen. F. A. Dudgeon, C.B.</p>

<p>The same day a warning order was received that the
Division would shortly move into the line to take part
in the second phase of the battle, which was to be renewed
as soon as weather conditions should permit.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>On the night of the 12th/13th August the Division
moved forward into the line opposite Glencorse Wood,
which had been the centre of the enemy's resistance on
the first day of the battle, and took over from portions
of the 18th and 25th Divisions a sector between the
Menin Road at Clapham Junction and the cross-roads at
Westhoek, the 169th Brigade occupying the right of this
front with the 167th Brigade on its left. The 53rd Brigade
of the 18th Division remained in line on the right of
the 169th Brigade, between Clapham Junction and Green
Jacket Road, and came under the orders of Gen. Dudgeon.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 12th the 168th Brigade in
Divisional reserve embussed at Steenvoorde for Canal
Reserve Camp, Dickebusch.</p>

<p>The chain of machine-gun posts still held by the enemy
in Inverness Copse, Glencorse Wood and Nonne Boschen
was of immense importance to the Germans at this
juncture; as they screened the long Spur which, running
north-east from the Menin Road Ridge between the
Polderhoek-Gheluvelt Ridge and the Zonnebeeke Road,
formed an important <i lang="fr">point d'appui</i> in the Langemarck-Gheluvelt
line of defence. Their capture by the British
would, therefore, drive such a wedge towards the enemy
third line as to cause a serious menace to his communications
along the Menin and Zonnebeeke Roads. No one
was more keenly alive to the essential value of this position
than the Germans, who spared no efforts to frustrate
attempts to launch a further attack in this area. The
continual severity of his shell and machine-gun fire against
our outpost line served his purpose well, as it not only
inflicted severe loss on the trench garrisons of the divisions
in the line and seriously impeded the task of advancing
ammunition and other stores incidental to an attack&mdash;a
task already difficult enough by reason of the wet state
of the ground&mdash;but also precluded efficient reconnaissance
of the ground over which the attack was to be launched.</p>

<p>The 56th Division was the extreme right of the attack.
The advance allotted to it was to be carried out by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
167th and 169th Brigades, whose objective was a line
beyond the third German line of defence, and which may
be roughly described as running north and south through
Polygon Wood. The southernmost point of this advance
was to be Black Watch Corner, and from this point it
would be necessary to connect the southern extremity
of the final objective with the line on the Division's right,
on which no advance would be attempted. This meant
the formation of a defensive flank facing nearly south.</p>

<p>This vital work of forming the flank was originally
entrusted to the 53rd Brigade, and the importance of
their rôle will be readily grasped, since on the manner in
which it was carried out would hang in large measure the
fortunes of the 169th and 167th and successive Brigades on
the left, for the German machine-guns in Inverness Copse,
if not silenced, would be free to enfilade the whole advance.
The 53rd Brigade which had been in the line since the
opening of the battle on the 31st July was, however,
now exhausted, and so seriously reduced in strength by
the tireless activity of the German machine-gunners that
it was not in a condition to renew the offensive. Its task
was therefore handed over to the 1/4th Londons, on whom
devolved the difficult operation above described of covering
the right flank of the whole attack. The only troops
of the 53rd Brigade who would be actively employed
would be a detachment of the 7th Bedfords, who were
made responsible for capturing the machine-gun nests
which, from the north-west corner of Inverness Copse,
dominated the whole situation.</p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons were detailed for this attack on the
morning of the 14th August, and it is important in view
of what subsequently occurred to bear this date in mind.
It must also be remembered that at this time the Battalion
was some seven miles from the field of battle and that no
officer, N.C.O. or man belonging to it had ever set eyes
on the ground over which the battle was to be fought.</p>

<p>During the morning Lieut.-Col. Campbell, the Adjutant
and the four company officers went forward to reconnoitre
the forward area, visiting in turn 169th Brigade Headquarters
at Dormy House, and Headquarters of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
Battalion in line of the 53rd Brigade at Stirling Castle.
It had been intended also to reconnoitre the ground over
which the advance was to be made, but such was the intensity
of the enemy's artillery and machine-gun fire that
this was impossible, and the company commanders were
compelled to return to their companies in ignorance of
what lay before them. Later in the day Lieut.-Col.
Campbell was ordered to report to 53rd Brigade Headquarters,
but was unluckily hit on his way back, near
Zillebeeke Lake. Although badly hit he made his way
back to the Battalion, but being unable to carry on was
succeeded in the command by Major A. F. Marchment,
M.C. (1/1st Londons).</p>

<p>At seven that night the Battalion moved forward from
Dickebusch to Château Segard, the move being completed
by 11 p.m. Shortly after dawn on the 15th the forward
move was continued to Railway Dugouts, in the cutting
between Shrapnel Corner and Zillebeeke Lake, and here
the Battalion remained during the day.</p>

<p>The 15th August was occupied in issuing battle
equipment and rations to the companies, while Lieut.-Col.
Marchment took the opportunity of conducting a
reconnaissance of the forward area and communications,
and of issuing his operation orders. These were explained
to company commanders as adequately as time
permitted, but it must be borne in mind that when the
Battalion moved forward to the assault the following
morning no company or platoon officer had been able
to see the ground over which he was to lead his men.
At 6.30 p.m. the 1/4th Londons left Railway Dugouts
in battle order for the assembly area at Clapham Junction
with guides supplied from the 53rd Brigade. A great
deal of heavy shelling, in which four men of B Company
were hit, was experienced during the advance, and in
breasting a ridge near Sanctuary Wood the Battalion had
to pass through a barrage put down by the Germans.
Aided by the excellent discipline of the troops, however,
company commanders were able to split up their companies
within a few seconds, and no loss was sustained.
By ten o'clock the Battalion was concentrated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
A, B and C Companies in the tunnel under the Menin Road,
and D Company in the trench south of the road.
Battalion Headquarters and part of C Company were in
the trench on the north side of the tunnel. There was
no defined line of trenches in this area, the front being
held by isolated shell hole posts, and the assembly was
to be made on tape lines laid down under staff arrangements.
The lack of shelter thus made it necessary to
keep the Battalion under such cover as was obtainable
till the last possible moment. During the evening an
officer of each company reconnoitred the route from the
concentration area to the tape lines, assistance being
rendered by the 6th Royal Berkshires, and No Man's Land
in front of the line of assembly was patrolled until shortly
before zero hour.</p>

<p>The intention was to advance in a practically due
east direction, while at stated points in the line of advance
platoons would halt one by one, each establishing itself
in a strong point, until finally, when the last platoon
reached its halting point, the whole Battalion would be
deployed in a line of outposts, all of which would turn
to their right and face south. This advance, being made
on a front of two companies, would result in a double line
of posts of which the left flank would rest on Black Watch
Corner in touch with the 169th Brigade, while the right
flank would join hands with the 7th Bedfords in the corner
of Inverness Copse.</p>

<p>At 3.15 a.m. on the 16th August companies began to
form up on the tape lines, the assembly being completed
by 4.20 a.m., when the troops were lying down in the open
under a continuous and fairly heavy shell fire and a galling
machine-gun fire from the direction of Inverness Copse.
About 22 casualties occurred under this fire before zero
hour at 5.45 a.m. The order of battle was as follows:
A. Company (Spiers) on the right and B Company
(Stanbridge) on the left in front; with D Company (H. N.
Williams) on the right and C Company (Rees) on the left
in support.</p>

<p>The attack was to be delivered along the whole battle
front at 5.45 a.m. under cover of a creeping barrage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
supported by machine-gun barrage and heavy gun fire
on the enemy back areas. At zero hour the British barrage
came down, well distributed and of terrific intensity. It
was hoped that the danger points in Inverness Copse
would be put out of action by our artillery, so that the
task of the 7th Bedfords would be an easy one, but calculations
in this respect were soon found to have been mistaken.
The leading companies of the 1/4th Londons got away
from the mark at zero, in good order and well up to the
barrage, but almost immediately came under a hail of
lead from Inverness Copse. The attack of the 7th Bedfords,
of such vital importance to the success of the whole operation,
had failed. The artillery fire had not produced the
expected effect on the enormously strong enemy posts
over which the barrage had passed harmlessly, and the
7th Bedfords were repulsed with loss, thereby leaving the
1/4th Londons completely exposed to the full force of
the enemy's nest of machine-guns on their right flank.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes 5 officers and 40 N.C.O.'s
and men of A and B Companies were casualties, but
the survivors pushed forward steadily, though a certain
amount of delay caused by the gaps so suddenly torn
in their ranks was inevitable. The gallantry displayed
by all ranks under this devastating machine-gun fire, to
which was added enemy shell fire of great intensity,
was unsurpassed, but under such a storm of bullets at
close range nothing could live, and the Battalion was
brought to a standstill about 200 yards from starting-point,
in an old German trench which skirted a ruined
farmhouse about midway between Inverness Copse and
Glencorse Wood.</p>

<p>A party of some 60 men of all companies managed to
gain shelter in Jap Avenue. Here they were organised
by 2/Lieut. H. E. Jackman, under whom a strong post
was consolidated and an attempt made to push forward
along the trench. This proved unsuccessful owing to the
continued intensity of the enemy machine-gun fire and
the accuracy of his sniping. Further attempts by other
companies to advance were also fruitless, and the Battalion
was forced to content itself with hanging on to these small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
gains, from which at intervals it was able to engage with
Lewis gun and rifle fire small bodies of the enemy in the
open near the east end of Glencorse Wood.</p>

<p>An attempt was made to re-establish the situation
by an attack, for which the 53rd Brigade was called
upon, through Inverness Copse from south to north, but
so terribly reduced in numbers were its battalions that
Brigade reserve was limited to two weak platoons and
further action was found to be for the moment impossible.</p>

<p>In the centre the leading waves of the 169th, after
some resistance in Glencorse Wood which they overcame,
succeeded in penetrating Polygon Wood, where they probably
gained their objective. The second waves on approaching
the Wood were, however, met with intense fire
from front and flanks, and a few minutes later a heavy
counter-attack developed which drove back the assaulting
troops to the middle of Glencorse Wood. A further
counter-attack in the evening forced the Brigade back to
its assembly line.</p>

<p>On the left the 167th Brigade met with but little
greater success. The advance was steadily conducted as
far as a line level with the eastern edge of Nonne Boschen,
where trouble was first encountered by a sea of mud&mdash;an
extensive bog caused by the springs in the source of the
Hanebeek&mdash;which forced the attacking battalions to edge
away to their left and thus lose touch with the 169th
Brigade on their right. In this position they came under
heavy machine-gun fire, and the British barrage having
got far ahead, were forced to fall back. By 9 a.m. this
Brigade also was back in its assembly area.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon enemy artillery fire over the
1/4th Battalion's front became very heavy, and retaliatory
fire was directed by our artillery into Inverness Copse.
No infantry action developed, and during the night the
Battalion was relieved by the 12th Middlesex and withdrew,
in support, to the tunnel under Crab Crawl Trench
in the old British system south of Sanctuary Wood.</p>

<p>Here the 1/4th Londons remained during the whole
of the 17th August, which passed uneventfully, and in the
evening was relieved by the 8th K.R.R.C. of the 14th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Division, which took over the 56th Division front. On
relief, the Battalion withdrew to Mic Mac Camp, Ouderdom.</p>

<p>Reviewing the Battalion's work on the 16th August it
must be at once admitted that it, and indeed the whole
Division, failed completely to perform its allotted task.
That all ranks did all that was possible to achieve it
is reflected in the length of the casualty list, and it is
perhaps due to those who fell to comment briefly on what
appear to be the causes of failure.</p>

<p>In the first place the operation itself was far from easy.
The sea of mud and ooze to which the line of advance
had been reduced must in any case have rendered the
recognition by platoon commanders of the spots at which
they were in turn to halt and form their post a matter
of some difficulty. But the circumstances in which the
Battalion became responsible for the attack effectually
precluded it from the preparations for the operation which
the difficulty of the task warranted. The change of
command was a further stroke of bad luck. Lieut.-Col.
Marchment was already known to the Battalion, but the
disadvantages under which he laboured in assuming command
on the eve of battle are obvious. The issue of orders
was inevitably delayed as Lieut.-Col. Campbell's reconnaissance
had to be repeated by Lieut.-Col. Marchment
on the morning of the 15th, and it was not till the evening
of that day that the scheme could be explained to companies,
and then only by officers, who themselves had
not seen the ground or even the assembly position. In
fact the operations of reconnaissance, issue of orders
and assembly of the Battalion had all to be disposed of
in twenty-two hours. In addition to these preliminary
difficulties the progress of the operation itself revealed
further circumstances, to which also a share of the responsibility
for failure may be attributed.</p>

<p>The extraordinary strength of the German machine-gun
posts was such that the most intense barrage which
the excellent Corps and Divisional artillery was capable
of producing passed harmlessly over them, and only a
direct hit was sufficient to disturb the occupants.</p>

<p>The very serious casualties at the outset of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
attack&mdash;half an hour after zero, three company commanders
were the only officers left standing&mdash;produced
inevitably a certain degree of disorganisation, though the
fact that despite these heavy losses the Battalion was able
to establish and maintain itself throughout the day until
relief, speaks wonders for the discipline of the troops and
the efficiency and initiative of the N.C.O.'s. Further
causes of failure lay in the previous exhaustion of the men
owing to the bad state of the ground, which also made
extremely difficult the preparation beforehand of forward
supply dumps, and the reinforcement of the attacking
troops during the battle.</p>

<p>Defeat is not always inglorious, and we feel that the
16th August may fairly be written down as a day on which
the 1/4th Londons failed without loss of reputation in any
single particular.</p>

<p>The casualties sustained were as follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>In officers&mdash;Lieut.-Col. H. Campbell, D.S.O., wounded; Lieuts.
C. A. Speyer, L. B. J. Elliott, L. W. Wreford and A. G. Davis,
killed; Capt. H. W. Spiers, Lieuts. A. S. Ford and E. G.
Dew, and 2/Lieuts. L. W. Archer, H. T, Hannay, N. Nunns
and H. E. Jackman, wounded; and in N.C.O.'s and men 182
killed and wounded.</p></div>

<p>2/Lieut. H. E. Jackman was awarded the M.C. for his
excellent work and devotion to duty this day.</p>

<p>Throughout the Division casualties were heavy and
6 commanding officers and nearly 4000 all ranks fell on
this unfortunate day.</p>

<p>On the remainder of the battle front varying success
was obtained. In the north a considerable advance was
made and the German third line was broken on a
wide front. The French attack on the extreme left was
crowned with complete success. In the southern area,
however, the enemy resistance was everywhere more
stubborn, and south of St Julien the line remained unchanged
as a result of the day's fighting. The Division
being concentrated in the Ouderdom area remained there
training and reorganising for several days.</p>

<p>On the 22nd August its move to the Eperlecques area
began, and on the 24th the 1/4th Londons entrained at
Reninghelst siding for Watten, where it detrained and
marched to Houlle.</p>

</div>

<p>The 56th Division had been so badly handled on the
16th August that its return to the battle area without
considerable reinforcement was out of the question and
it was, therefore, moved from the Ypres area to Bapaume.
The Battalion accordingly entrained at Arques in the early
hours of the 30th August and arrived in huts in the
Beaulencourt area at 8 p.m. the same day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

THE THIRD BATTLE OF YPRES</h2>


<h3>II. <em>The 2/4th Battalion on the Northern Ridges</em></h3>

<p>After the restricted success of the 16th August, the renewal
of operations on a large scale was inevitably postponed
for some time through the continuance of adverse
weather conditions; though in the north minor operations
had the effect of widening and deepening the breach in
the German defences in the neighbourhood of St Julien,
combined with the capture of a good many prisoners.
These local advances carried the British positions forward
east of the St Julien-Poelcapelle Road and gave them a
firm footing in the Gheluvelt-Langemarck line on both
sides of the Ypres-Staden Railway.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of some of the divisions which had been
engaged in the battle since the end of July being now necessary,
the 58th Division was among the fresh divisions
which were sent north to take part in the next large attack.</p>

<p>On the 24th August the 2/4th Londons marched
from Izel-les-Hameau to Aubigny entraining for Hopoutre
(Poperinghe), whence it marched to quarters in Dirty
Bucket Camp, one of a series of camps near Vlamertinghe.
The Division now became attached to the XVIII Corps
(Maxse). The Battalion continued its training in the new
area, paying a good deal of attention to intensive digging
and musketry, and during the days spent in Dirty Bucket
the company commanders and seconds in command
attended a course of instruction at the XVIII Corps
School at Volckeringhove.</p>

<p>On the night of the 28th/29th August the 58th Division
entered the trenches, taking over with the 174th and 175th
Brigades, the sector occupied by the 48th Division east
of St Julien, the frontage extending from the Hanebeek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
on the right to the vicinity of Keerselare on the left. The
sector was lightly held with one battalion of each brigade
in the outpost line, one battalion on the Canal Bank and
two in camps west of the Yser Canal.</p>

<p>The 173rd Brigade remained in Divisional reserve and
continued training. The 2/4th Londons changed station
on the last day of the month, moving to Browne Camp,
about four miles north-east of Poperinghe. Here a
further week's training was obtained, after which the
whole of B Company spent four days at the Fifth Army
Musketry Camp near St Omer. Nothing worthy of record
occurred during this period except on the 1st September,
when the transport lines were heavily shelled causing
casualties to 26 N.C.O.'s and men, of whom 1 died of
wounds, and to 13 horses, 8 being killed.</p>

<p>Reinforcements at this period included 2/Lieut.
A. C. Knight (4th Londons) and 2/Lieut. W. D. Warren
(19th Londons), and about 110 N.C.O.'s and men.</p>

<p>On the 9th September the 2/4th Londons moved
forward to Reigersburg Camp, between Brielen and the
Canal, and on the 11th-13th August the 173rd Brigade
took over the whole Divisional sector.</p>

<p>A warning order had now been issued as to the next
attack which in view of the markedly improved conditions
of weather had been arranged for the 20th September.
The front of attack was more extended than on the
16th August, the southern limit being the Ypres-Comines
Canal near Hollebeke, and the Ypres-Staden Railway
north of Langemarck marking the northern extremity.</p>

<p>The success which had attended the enemy's resistance
to our efforts to advance in the Menin Road region had
pointed to the necessity of modifying the methods of
attack. The successes obtained by the British Army
on the Somme, at Arras and at Messines, had caused the
Germans to alter their mode of defence, and instead of
a strongly held trench line they now presented to our
attacks a system of concreted machine-gun posts ("pillboxes"
"or Mebus") disposed in great depth in front
of their main line of resistance. This system supplied
their defence with the elasticity which had hitherto been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
lacking, and the pillboxes, being sited with remarkable
skill to develop the employment of enfilade fire to the
fullest extent, proved a very serious obstacle to British
assaulting columns, which frequently suffered severe
casualties at their hands after making a deep advance into
the enemy defensive system. The pillboxes were, moreover,
of such enormously strong construction that nothing
short of a direct hit by a heavy shell could put them out
of action. The effect of our severe artillery preparation
for attacks was therefore nullified, and the occupants of
the pillboxes could only be ejected as a rule by hand-to-hand
fighting with bombs.</p>

<p>This new feature in the fighting called for prompt
measures on the part of the British, and henceforward
no attempt was made as a rule to penetrate the enemy's
pillbox system as long as any risk existed of leaving any
of these hornets' nests undisposed of in rear of the advancing
troops. In other words, the attacks were arranged
with objectives much more limited than formerly, while
the artillery paid more attention to the pillboxes, the
ultimate capture of which formed the task of special units
detailed for the purpose.</p>

<p>The assault arranged for the 20th September was
prepared on these revised lines, and all ranks were impressed
beforehand with the importance, not only of
locating enemy strong points quickly and rushing them
before their occupants had recovered from the British
barrage, but also of methodical "mopping-up" and consolidation
of all ground gained.</p>

<p>From the 9th September onwards the work of preparation
for the impending offensive was pushed forward
with all possible speed, the 2/4th Londons bearing a heavy
share of these necessary duties. For four of the five
nights spent at Reigersburg Camp a working party of the
strength of two companies was engaged in completing
the advanced cable line trench, while on the last night,
the 13th, the whole Battalion less B Company (still at the
Musketry Camp) was detailed for carrying various sorts
of R.E. material forward to advanced dumps in readiness
for consolidation of the position it was hoped to gain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 14th the 2/4th Londons moved to a fresh
position on the east side of the Yser Canal, and for four
nights following, the whole Battalion was engaged in the
desperate task of laying a duckboard track of double
width in front of St Julien, as far forward as possible in
the direction of the enemy positions, with the object
of providing a means of communication in the forward
area, and of reinforcing or relieving the advanced troops
after the assault should have been delivered.</p>

<p>This week of continual working parties was most
exhausting to all concerned. The distance to be covered
each night to and from the scene of the work was about
three and a half miles in each direction, and the labour
of the march was increased tenfold by the shocking condition
of the ground, which was still waterlogged, and,
away from the defined tracks, nothing but a series of
lakes formed by shell craters full of water. Heavy as the
cable line duties were found, the laying of the duckboard
track during the latter half of the week proved still more
onerous. Not only had the troops to march to St Julien
from the Canal Bank, but the duckboards which were
drawn from a dump at Alberta Farm had to be carried
on the men's shoulders for some five hundred yards to
the starting-point of the track. Progress was slow through
the heavy going and the continual delays caused by
German Véry lights. Although some two hundred and
forty yards were laid during the four nights' work, and
the track was carried forty yards beyond our most
advanced positions, the task was never completed.
The work was obviously fraught with considerable risk
of serious casualties owing to the large numbers of
men employed, and in the circumstances the losses
incurred during the week were light; 11 men being hit
on the 11th, while on the 15th 2/Lieut. Carlisle was
killed and 2/Lieut. Pike wounded, with 2 men killed and
5 wounded.</p>

<p>On the night of the 18th the 2/4th Londons relieved
the 2/3rd Londons in the line, which was still held by
isolated posts, and the following evening assembly for
the attack began at about 9 p.m.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>The 58th Division front of attack was entirely north
of the Hanebeek, a small stream which runs almost due
east from St Julien, the attack south of the stream being
undertaken by the 164th Brigade of the 55th Division.
The 58th Divisional front was taken up by the 173rd
Brigade on the right with the 174th on its left, the assaulting
columns of the 173rd Brigade consisting of four companies,
each 100 strong, of the 2/4th Londons. The 2/3rd
Londons were in reserve to make a dummy attack, with
one company on the waterlogged portions of the front
over which no advance was possible.</p>

<p>The 2/4th Londons' assembly position which was
defined by tape lines laid down by the adjutant,
Capt. A. Grover, was on the line Janet Farm-Springfield,
and covered a front of some 800 yards. Almost in the
centre of this front and some 400 yards from starting-point,
lay a strongly fortified area around Winnipeg cross-roads.
To the right of the cross-roads the whole area
as far as the Hanebeek was waterlogged and impassable,
while to the left a series of enemy strong points, notably
at the Cemetery and Spot Farm seemed likely to cause a
good deal of trouble to the attackers. The objective of
the 2/4th Londons lay on an undefined line running
roughly north and south about 100 yards beyond
Winnipeg cross-roads. This marked the limit of the
173rd Brigade's task, though the objective of the day
lay about 500 yards further east, its principal feature
being a machine-gun nest in the Schuler Galleries in the
vicinity of the Hanebeek. The further advance to this
final objective was entrusted to the 164th and 174th
Brigades, who by a converging movement were to
"squeeze out" the 2/4th Londons leaving them in
occupation of what would become a line of supporting
posts at the end of the day.</p>

<p>Before the assembly a preliminary reconnaissance of
the terrain was carried out by the company commanders,
and in connection with this Capt. Hetley writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I think all were impressed by the wonderful sight at
Admirals Road. This unsavoury road ran parallel to
the front about 1500 yards or more to the rear of St Julien<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
and when passing over it on the duckboard track, there
could be seen guns in such large quantities that there
seemed to be very little greater interval than 150-200
yards between them in any direction&mdash;a really wonderful
contrast to April 1915, when the Lahore Division was on
exactly the same spot.</p></div>

<p>On the evening of the 19th September Brigade Headquarters
were established at Cheddar Villa, while the 2/4th
Londons' Battle Headquarters opened in St Julien. The
assembly was conducted by Capt. Grover and Lieut. Seys
(Intelligence Officer) who were solely responsible for an
operation which proved exceedingly difficult owing to the
still heavy state of the ground. So bad was the mud that
men constantly sank to their knees, and in some cases touch
could only be maintained by tying the men of each section
together with tapes. In spite of these difficulties the 400
men were in position by 3 a.m. on the 20th without a
hitch, and with practically no casualties, although the
most advanced platoons were within 150 yards of the
enemy positions. The assembly completed, the 2/3rd
Londons who were holding the line withdrew a short
distance to the rear.</p>

<p>The assault was delivered at 5.40 a.m. under cover
of an intense creeping barrage which proved to be excellent,
and companies moved off in good order in the half
light close up to the barrage. The companies were disposed
as follows: on the right A Company (S. Davis)
with two platoons and Headquarters of D Company
(Stark) attached; in the centre B Company (Hetley);
and on the left C Company (Hewlett) with two platoons
of D Company attached.</p>

<p>The principal resistance, as had been anticipated, was
encountered in the neighbourhood of Winnipeg cross-roads,
and at a pillbox which lay between them and
the cemetery. This was most gallantly captured single-handed
by Pte. Bolton, A Company, who bayonetted three
of the occupants and captured the remainder consisting
of an officer and three men. A slight check at the cross-roads
produced a further small bag of prisoners, sixteen in
number, of whom one was an officer. On the left the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
opposition was encountered at a pillbox some 300 yards
east of Springfield which was holding up the advance of
C Company and of the 174th Brigade on the left. 2/Lieut.
F. W. Walker, quickly grasping the situation, outflanked
the position with six men, and succeeded in rushing it,
capturing two machine-guns and twenty men who were
sent back under escort, Walker and the rest of his party
at once pushing on to the objective where touch was gained
with the 174th Brigade. Within half an hour the 2/4th
Londons were established on their objective, the consolidation
of which was promptly put in hand, while the flank
brigades after a pause of half an hour pressed forward to
their final objectives in accordance with the plan of attack.</p>

<p>The complete success of this operation was undoubtedly
due to the careful provision which had been made in
advance for the capture of strong points by specially
detailed units who thus ensured the efficient "mopping-up"
of all ground captured, while enabling the remainder
of the assaulting column to keep well up to the barrage.</p>

<p>Owing to the known strength of Schuler Farm in the
final objective, special arrangements had been made for
the attack of this point, in conjunction with the 164th
Brigade, by a strong platoon of D Company 2/4th Londons
with which two tanks were to co-operate in an outflanking
movement from the north. The earliest reports from this
region indicated that the attack had been successful,
but subsequent information made it clear that the first
attack failed, partly owing to the non-arrival of the tanks
which stuck fast in the mud, and partly owing to unexpected
resistance met with at a machine-gun post some
150 yards in advance of the farm. The capture of this
post, which produced 16 prisoners and 2 guns, cost the lives
of 2/Lieut. Warren and the whole platoon except Sergt.
Watson and 6 men. The delay caused, moreover, was
serious, and by the time the survivors of the platoon were
able to continue their advance, the barrage had passed
beyond Schuler Farm. Sergt. Watson, being of opinion
that the strength of his party was insufficient to justify
an attack on the main position, sent back his prisoners and
established himself with the captured machine-guns at a
point about 250 yards south-east of Winnipeg cross-roads.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>The shell fire of the enemy during the advance and
subsequent to the Battalion reaching its objective had
been severe, and by this time not more than 100 rifles
of the 2/4th Londons remained effective. Arrangements
were therefore made to stiffen its line with one company
of the 2/3rd Londons. A further attack on Schuler Farm,
to be undertaken by the 2/3rd Londons, was organised for
daybreak on the 21st.</p>

<p>At about three o'clock in the afternoon the enemy
was observed to be advancing in fours against the brigade
on our right, and the artillery was immediately called into
action. In spite of heavy losses, however, the enemy
continued to advance with praiseworthy courage until
they deployed, when their morale appeared to break
and their ranks rapidly melted under our shell fire.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the day a good deal of annoyance
was caused by the continued sniping from Schuler
Farm, of which the Germans remained in possession, but
no further counter-attack developed on our front, and
night fell with the 2/4th Londons' position intact. The
casualties already suffered had been heavy, and three
company commanders, Hewlett, Stark and Davis, had
unluckily been hit, though the last was able to remain with
his company until after relief the following evening, when
having been wounded a second time he was evacuated.</p>

<p>The attack of the platoon of the 2/3rd Londons
under 2/Lieut. Middlemiss on the 21st was postponed for
further reconnaissance, in the course of which Middlemiss
observed the garrison of Schuler Farm surrender to men
of the 164th Brigade. Believing the situation to be clear
he proceeded along the road, but was hit by fire from a
post by the Hanebeek near that established by Sergt.
Watson. Middlemiss' report, which was the first information
obtained of the fall of Schuler Farm, caused the
alteration of his platoon's objective to the pillbox from
which he had been hit, but in the evening this was found
to have been evacuated by its garrison, so that the whole
position was now in our hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>During the evening of the 21st violent counter-attacks
under cover of intense bombardments were delivered
against the 164th and 174th Brigade sectors, but these
were dispersed, and the 2/4th Londons did not come into
action though their newly-dug trenches were almost
obliterated by the German shell fire and many more
casualties occurred.</p>

<p>At 9 p.m. on the 21st, the 2/4th Londons handed over
their position, intact at all points, to the 2/9th Londons, and
withdrew across the Yser Canal to Dambre Camp, where
they remained training and reorganising for some days.</p>

<p>This was the most completely successful operation in
which the 2/4th Battalion had hitherto taken part, and
indeed all along the line of the Fifth Army attack the new
methods which have been described met with marked
success.</p>

<p>The outstanding achievements of the day were those
of 2/Lieut. Walker, Sergt. Watson and Pte. Bolton, of
which some description has already been given, but reference
should also be made to the excellent work of
Capt. S. Davis, whose clear grasp of situations and the
accurate and complete information with which he kept
Headquarters constantly supplied, were of great value;
of Pte. Austin, runner of A Company, who passed backwards
and forwards several times with important messages
through intense barrages; of Pte. Bull, the only surviving
stretcher-bearer of A Company, who displayed the greatest
coolness and devotion in tending wounded men under
heavy fire; and Lieut. Altounyan, the medical officer,
whose services were of the utmost value and carried out
under exceedingly trying conditions.</p>

<p>Mention should also be made of Pte. Anthony of the
Battalion Signallers who from an advanced point in the
line established visual communication with Brigade Headquarters,
his station subsequently proving of great value
to the supporting artillery.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 19th Brig.-Gen. Freyberg, V.C.,
D.S.O., was seriously hit on his way to Battle Headquarters
at Cheddar Villa; but he insisted on remaining at
duty, and directed operations from his stretcher, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
wounded in ten places, until after news of the complete
capture of the objective was received the next day, when
his removal was insisted upon by the A.D.M.S. who came
forward to fetch him. Command of the Brigade was taken
temporarily by Lieut.-Col. Dann, D.S.O.</p>

<p>The following decorations were awarded after this
action: 2/Lieut. F. W. Walker, the D.S.O.; Capts. A.
Grover and S. Davis, and Lieut. E. H. R. Altounyan,
the M.C.; Sergt. Watson, Ptes. Bolton, Austin, Anthony
and Bull, the D.C.M.; and Sergts. H. O. Wilderspin and
F. W. Yandle, Ptes. J. W. Ling and A. Westcott, the M.M.</p>

<p>The casualties sustained during the action included:
2/Lieuts. H. N. Bundle, E. R. Seabury and W. D. Warren,
killed; 2/Lieut. F. B. Burd, died of wounds; Capts. W. A.
Stark, H. A. T. Hewlett and S. Davis, M.C., 2/Lieuts.
D. S. Boorman, M. C. (at duty), A. J. Angel, W. F. Vines
and A. C. Knight, wounded; and 60 N.C.O.'s and men
killed, 176 wounded and 29 missing.</p>

<p>The 58th Division remained in line after this attack,
and on the 26th September took part in the third general
attack which was delivered by the Second and Fifth
Armies on a front of some six miles, of which the northern
limit was the Divisional sector. The attack was delivered
by the 175th Brigade and a further considerable success
gained, the Divisional front having been carried forward
in the operations since the 19th a total distance of about
1600 yards.</p>

<p>On the 27th September, the 2/4th Londons moved to
Brake Camp, in the Vlamertinghe area. Two days were
occupied in training here, during which the area in which
the Battalion was located suffered on the night of the
28th/29th September the most prolonged and serious
bombing by enemy aircraft it ever experienced, the bombardment
lasting without cessation from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m.
Fortunately no casualties were sustained.</p>

<p>At Brake Camp the following joined the Battalion:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Capt. R. C. Dickins.</p>

<p>2/Lieuts. C. C. Gibbs, D. G. Spring, F. J. Jones, E. G. Gardner
and A. W. Dodds (21st Londons); and 2/Lieut. S. J.
Richardson (7th Londons).</p>

<p>250 N.C.O.'s and men.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p>Further casualties during September included Lieut.,
C. Potter and 2/Lieuts. O. H. Mattison and J. McDonald,
to hospital.</p>

<p>2/Lieut. Cook was appointed to the 173rd L.T.M.
Battery.</p>

<p>On the 30th September the 58th Division was withdrawn
from the line and concentrated as Corps reserve
for rest in the Nordausques area (eight miles north-west
of St Omer), and the 2/4th Londons moved by rail from
Vlamertinghe to Zouafques where they went into billets
on the 1st October. The train was followed and bombed
during the journey by German airmen, 1 sergeant and
2 men being killed.</p>

<p>During the period of the 58th Division's withdrawal
from the line the offensive was pressed forward under
adverse conditions of weather. The season was now
becoming advanced and the condition of the ground offered
a far greater obstacle to our progress than the enemy's
resistance. Probably no series of battles of the whole war
was waged under such persistently adverse conditions,
or imposed a greater physical strain on the attacking
troops. In every direction the salient was by now a
series of "shell hole lakes" the ground being waterlogged
and the mud more glutinous than ever. An increasing
number of casualties to men and beasts occurred through
drowning in the shell holes of this ghastly shell-battered
inferno, but though the whole forces of the elements
seemed to be arrayed against us, advances of enormous
importance were achieved during the early part of October,
as a result of which the Allied positions were pushed
forward to the outskirts of Houthulst Forest, to the east
of Poelcapelle and to within 2000 yards of Passchendaele.</p>

<p>The prolonged continuance of active operations was
obviously becoming increasingly difficult, but G.H.Q. was
impelled to pursue the course of this dreary offensive
partly by reason of the serious situation caused on the
Italian front by the defeat of Caporetto at the end of
October, and partly by the need of containing as many
German divisions as possible during the preparations for
the Cambrai battle, which were not yet complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>The 2/4th Londons remained at Zouafques training
and reorganising for over three weeks. Several drafts
were received from the Base, which together made the
considerable addition of 244 N.C.O.'s and men to the
Battalion strength, thus bringing it above its numbers
prior to the action of the 20th September.</p>

<p>On the 15th October the Battalion was joined by
2/Lieut. H. G. Langton; and by 2/Lieuts. H. A. Snell,
J. R. Naylor and R. J. Richards (1st Londons). During
this period also 2/Lieuts. H. E. English and C. C. H.
Clifford were evacuated sick. Capt. S. H. Stedman was
posted to the 173rd Brigade Labour Company at Louches.</p>

<p>On the 23rd October the 2/4th Londons returned by
train to the Vlamertinghe area and took over quarters
in Siege Camp, moving the following day to the concentration
area on the canal bank, whence the battle surplus
under 2/Lieut. Askham left the Battalion for the Divisional
Depôt Battalion.</p>

<p>On the 25th October, Major W. A. Nunneley, second
in command of the Battalion since July 1916, fell sick
and was evacuated to hospital, his duties being taken
over by the adjutant, Capt. A. Grover, M.C. Major
Nunneley was subsequently appointed to command the
German officers' Prisoners of War Camp at Donington
Hall. Capt. Grover, M.C., was succeeded in the Adjutancy
by Lieut. F. W. Walker, D.S.O. On the 22nd 2/Lieut
D. G. Spring was seconded to the XX Corps School as
Instructor.</p>

<p>The operation in which the 173rd Brigade was detailed
to take part was arranged for the 26th October, and consisted
of an attack on a frontage from the Ypres-Roulers
Railway (south of Passchendaele) to beyond Poelcapelle.
The task of the 173rd Brigade, who were flanked on the
right by the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division and on the left
by the 57th Division, was to carry forward the British
line east of Poelcapelle for some 700 yards in a due
easterly direction astride the Poelcapelle-Westroosebeeke
Road. The Divisional frontage was some 1800 yards in
length, and bounded on the north by the Poelcapelle-Staden
Road and on the south by the Lekkerbotebeek.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
The assaulting troops were provided by the 2/2nd, 2/3rd
and 2/4th Londons, while the 2/1st Londons were in
Brigade reserve, with two battalions of the 174th Brigade
concentrated in the old German trench system near
St Julien, also at the disposal of the 173rd Brigade.</p>

<p>The first objective, which was on the line Spider Crossroads-Moray
House, was to be taken by the 2/2nd and
2/3rd Battalions, while after a pause of 45 minutes, the
2/4th Londons were to "leapfrog" through them on to
the second and final objective.</p>

<p>As in the September action, particular preparation
was made for the assault of all known pillboxes by special
parties, and the system of posts to be established by each
company was carefully and definitely decided beforehand.
The whole strength of the Battalion was necessary to
cover the wide frontage allotted to it, the order of battle
from the right being D Company (C. A. Clarke), C Company
(Boorman), B Company (Hetley) and A Company
(Dickins). In addition to the stipulated frontage the
Battalion was also held responsible for some 200 yards
of waterlogged ground near the Lekkerbotebeek on its
right, over which touch with the 63rd Division could not
be actively maintained.</p>

<p>The attack was to be delivered under a creeping
barrage supported by heavy guns, machine-guns and
smoke barrages, while look-out for enemy counter-attacks
was to be maintained by aeroplanes.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 25th the 2/4th Londons left
Siege Camp in battle order and moved forward to positions
in the original front German system where they remained
until the afternoon. At 3 p.m. the forward move was
resumed, and the Battalion was completely assembled
in its allotted area immediately east of Poelcapelle by
10.15 p.m., Battalion Headquarters being established at
Gloster Farm.</p>

<p>The weather had for some days past shown a marked
improvement, and the ground over which the advance
was to be made was reported to be drying fast. But
our much-tried troops could not escape their usual fate
in the matter of weather, for on the night of the 25th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
rain fell pitilessly once more, filling up the shell holes,
liquefying the mud and drenching everyone to the skin.
All movement was rendered a matter of extraordinary
difficulty, and when the time for the attack arrived the
assaulting columns could scarcely drag themselves forward.</p>

<p>The British front line being composed of a line of
unconnected posts, the actual "jumping-off " line was
defined by tapes which made it essential to attack before
daybreak. At 5.30 a.m. the British barrage came down,
and the 2/2nd and 2/3rd Battalions followed by the 2/4th
began their laborious advance. The barrage was disappointing,
for not only was it not as well distributed as
on former occasions, but, having regard to the state of the
ground, it advanced far too quickly so that the assaulting
troops were soon left far behind.</p>

<p>The 2/2nd Londons were successful in capturing four
pillboxes of which three were at Cameron Houses, about
half-way to the first objective, while the 2/3rd Londons
on the left pushed forward to what was at the time believed
to be Spider cross-roads, but was probably a less important
road junction some 250 yards short of it. The
line of this cross-road and Cameron Houses was, however,
the limit of the advance, which was unsupported on the
left owing to the adjoining division on that flank having
been held up. The only post taken by the 2/4th Londons
was Tracas Farm on the extreme right.</p>

<p>The men were now thoroughly exhausted by their
efforts, and were practically defenceless as the mud had
choked rifles and Lewis guns, and rendered them temporarily
useless. Indeed, for over half an hour the Battalion
possessed hardly a single rifle which could be fired. At
this juncture the enemy counter-attacked in great force
both at Cameron Houses and on the unsupported left
flank, and his attack, as was to be expected in the circumstances,
was successful, and our troops were driven back
with severe loss to the assembly line where the enemy's
advance was finally held.</p>

<p>After their rough handling of the morning it was clear
that the attacking battalions could not pursue the offensive
or remain in the line, and arrangements were accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
made for their relief, on the south of the Poelcapelle-Westroosebeeke
Road by the 2/1st Londons and on the
north of it by the 2/7th Londons. The relief was completed
by 10.15 p.m., and the 2/4th Londons returned to
Siege Camp.</p>

<p>In other parts of the line greater success was achieved
this day, notably in the vicinity of Passchendaele where
the Canadians captured all their objectives, and on the
extreme left in the area held by the French.</p>

<p>The 26th October must be regarded as one of the most
unfortunate days ever experienced by the 2/4th Londons.
The gallantry of officers, N.C.O.'s and men alike left
nothing to be desired, and their defeat was at the hands
of the elements far more than of the Germans. So bad
indeed was the state of the ground that not a few men,
becoming stuck in the mud and exhausted by their efforts
to extricate themselves, met their death by drowning in
the flooded shell holes.</p>

<p>For their good work on this day decorations were
awarded to Capt. C. A. Clarke (the M.C.) and Pte C. H. W.
Roberts (the D.C.M.).</p>

<p>The casualties sustained in this unfortunate affair were
in officers: 2/Lieuts. F. J. Jones, H. G. Langton and
J. R. Naylor, killed; 2/Lieut. R. J. Richards, died of
wounds; Capts. R. C. Dickins and D. S. Boorman, M.C.,
2/Lieuts. G. E. Lester, R. Michell, H. A. Snell and A. W.
Dodds, wounded; and in N.C.O.'s and men 25 killed,
214 wounded and 109 missing&mdash;a total of 359 all ranks.
This was the most costly single day in the history of the
2/4th Battalion.</p>

<p>The 2/4th Londons spent five days at Brake Camp
cleaning up, resting and reorganising, moving on the 1st
November to Roads Camp, and on the following day to St
Jans-ter-biezen, about four miles west of Poperinghe. The
Battalion was now reduced to an organisation of one company
for fighting purposes, pending the arrival of further
reinforcements to fill the gaps created on the 26th October.</p>

<p>On the 6th November a further move was made to
P Camp near Peselhoek, north of Poperinghe, and here
the Battalion remained for eight days, all of which were
occupied in training except for three working parties of
100 N.C.O.'s and men under Capt. Hetley who proceeded
to Gwent Farm for stretcher-bearing duties.</p>

<p>A further attempt was made by the 175th Brigade on
the 30th October to complete the unfulfilled task of the
26th, but again the state of the ground rendered the operation
abortive. On the higher ground, however, Canadian
troops again achieved some success, and by the 6th
November had captured Passchendaele.</p>

<p>Thus was this stupendous offensive brought to a close.
It had been maintained for three and a half months under
conditions of unprecedented difficulty, and at enormous
cost in personnel. Having regard to the obstacles which
were encountered at every step the achievement was
magnificent, and had served a definite purpose in the
War, not only by securing positions on the high ground
for the winter, but also by assisting our French and Italian
Allies at a period when, especially in the case of the
latter, any operation which could relieve the pressure on
their front was of vital importance.</p>

<p>On the 15th November the Division was concentrated
in Corps reserve, and the 2/4th Londons moved to
Piccadilly Camp in the Proven area.</p>

<p>The 2/4th Londons now spent a prolonged period
out of the battle area; occupying billets successively,
after leaving Piccadilly Camp, at Coulemby on the
26th November, at Bellebrune and Cremarest (about
twelve miles west of St Omer) from the 27th November
to the 9th December, and at Soult Camp near Brielen,
to which the Battalion moved on the last-mentioned date
in anticipation of returning to the trenches.</p>

<p>This period of training passed with the usual routine
of "back-of-the-line" training in drill, musketry, bombing,
route marching and games, interspersed with highly
welcome entertainments given by the Divisional concert
troop "The Goods." Advantage was taken of the time
spent in rest to refill the gaps in the Battalion's ranks,
and an excellent opportunity was afforded of assimilating
the newly-received drafts as they arrived and before they
were called upon to go into action. These drafts totalled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
213 N.C.O.'s and men, but even with this accession of
strength the 2/4th Londons still remained considerably
weaker than prior to the recent action.</p>

<p>Officer reinforcements were more numerous in proportion,
and included:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Lieuts. H. J. M. Williams and G. E. Lester.</p>

<p>2/Lieuts. R. W. Chamberlain, E. P. Higgs and L. H. Sheppard.</p>

<p>2/Lieut. F. B. Johnson (13th Londons).</p>

<p>Lieut. F. J. Griffiths, 2/Lieuts. F. E. Norrish, F. G. Williams,
W. H. G. Newman and W. Blair (20th Londons).</p>

<p>2/Lieuts. S. H. Jehu and J. R. Peryer (21st Londons).</p>

<p>Lieut. C. A. Sampson (25th Londons).</p>

<p>Lieuts. E. R. Howden and J. Cairns (A.S.C.).</p></div>

<p>On the 16th/17th December the 173rd Brigade took
over the whole Divisional sector, which constituted the left
of the II Corps front, from the Lekkerbotebeeke on the
right to the Broembeek, a small stream close to the
Ypres-Staden Railway on the left. The Corps line was
in practically the same position as on the occasion of the
Battalion's last visit to this area, and ran roughly north
and south in front of Poelcapelle, and about 500 yards
east of the Poelcapelle-Houthulst Road. The front line,
which was occupied in a series of isolated shell hole
posts, which were being strengthened and linked up to
each other as opportunity offered, was held by two
battalions, with support battalions in the captured German
trenches around Langemarck and Pilckem.</p>

<p>The 2/4th Battalion took over from the 2/10th Londons
the left support position in Eagle and Candle Trenches on
the 16th December, thus covering a depth of about 3500
yards. The ground between the forward and rear companies
was a quagmire of battered trenches, and work
was immediately necessary to attempt to reduce the chaos
of the defensive system to something approaching cohesion.
After five quiet days in these positions the Battalion moved
forward to the left front positions, relieving the 2/3rd
Londons on the 20th December with three companies in line
and one in support. Headquarters were at Louis Farm.</p>

<p>With the exception of an attack against our left company
which was attempted under a severe barrage on the
afternoon of the 22nd, and which was effectually dispersed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
the tour passed quietly and the Battalion was relieved
on the 24th December by the 2/10th Londons, and
concentrated at Battle Siding (Brielen), entraining there
for Elverdinghe. Casualties were 2/Lieut. Jehu and 10
N.C.O.'s and men wounded and shell-shocked.</p>

<p>A week at Bridge No. 1 Camp, occupied for the
most part in training and bathing, was enlivened by the
Christmas festivities, for which such provision as was
possible had been made, the outstanding feature being the
production by "The Goods" of their famous pantomime,
"The Babes in the Wood," which proved an immediate
and enormous success.</p>

<p>New Year's Day 1918 found the Battalion once more
in left support positions in Whitemill, Eagle, Bear and
Candle Trenches, with Headquarters in dugouts at Langemarck
which rejoiced in the name of Pig and Whistle.
Five days of peaceful trench work here were succeeded by
an uneventful tour in the front line positions, and on the
8th January the Battalion handed over its trenches to
the 17th Lancashire Fusiliers preparatory to the withdrawal
of the whole Division. Concentrating on relief
at Bridge No. 1 Camp the Battalion moved the following
day to School Camp, Proven, where a few days' rest was
obtained. The G.O.C. II Corps here presented ribands
to those who had recently been decorated.</p>

<p>Officer reinforcements at this period were:</p>

<div class="hangindent8">

<p>27th December&mdash;2/Lieuts. P. J. Payne, N. A. Brown and V. C.
Prince.</p>

<p>10th January&mdash;2/Lieuts. S. F. G. Mears, E. M. Cuthbertson,
S. C. Geering and G. C. Ewing.</p></div>

<p>Early in January Lieut. D. C. Cooke went to hospital
and the medical officer, Lieut. Altounyan, M.C. (wounded),
was replaced by Lieut. C. E. Dunaway, U.S. Army.</p>

<p>On the 21st January the 2/4th Londons finally left the
Ypres area after nearly five months of hard work in it,
and the 58th Division was transferred to the III Corps
(Pulteney) in the Fifth Army which had now removed to
the extreme south of the British lines.</p>

<p>In recognition of their good work in these actions, all
"other ranks" of the Battalion were subsequently granted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
permission to wear a small grenade&mdash;similar to that worn
as a cap badge, but smaller&mdash;on the corners of the tunic
collar.</p>

<p>This closes the regiment's connection with the Ypres
Salient, the scene of so much hardship and suffering, but
at the same time of so much gallantry and devotion to duty.
Ypres occupies a position in the estimation of the Empire
which is challenged by no place in which British troops
served in the War; and it must be for ever a source of
pride to the regiment that it was privileged to take part
in the second and third battles for its liberation from the
Germans.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

THE 1/4TH BATTALION IN THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI, 1917</h2>


<p>The 30th August 1917 found the 1/4th Battalion much
reduced in strength moving from Arques to Bapaume, to
the great satisfaction of all ranks, for all had been expecting
a return to the unhealthy conditions of the Ypres
Salient. On detrainment at Bapaume an evening march
was made to Beaulencourt, where quarters were allotted
in a concentration camp. This march was not without
interest as it was the Battalion's first introduction to the
"devastated area," the appalling lifeless and ruined belt
of country left behind him by the Bosche in his retirement
from the Ancre-Scarpe salient to the Hindenburg line.
Beaulencourt lies between Bapaume and Le Transloy, and
is thus on the ridge which lay beyond the old Lesbœufs lines
and which had proved the final check to the Battalion's
advances in the Somme battles of 1916. From the village
the Lesbœufs-Morval Ridge was visible, though of those
two ill-fated villages no ruins were discernible. The whole
area was a vast waste of rank vegetation which was
rapidly covering the scars of the previous year's battles
without healing them. Shell fire had contributed comparatively
little to the desolation, but villages had been
completely demolished and trees felled, and the British
troops themselves provided the only relief to the awful
silence of this strange land from which the life of the fields
had vanished.</p>

<p>The Battalion was now attached to the IV Corps
(Woollcombe), and the first few days were spent in
very necessary reorganisation of its slender resources in
personnel. The casualties of the Ypres action were not
replaced by drafts, and each company was reduced to two
platoons. That such work as was possible was done to
good purpose was shown on the 4th September, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
Corps commander inspected the Battalion and expressed
himself gratified at the completeness and good order of
its clothing and equipment in view of its recent withdrawal
from the Flanders battlefield. This day was
the third anniversary of the Battalion's departure from
England.</p>

<p>Between the 5th and 8th September the 56th Division
took over from the 3rd the left sector of the IV Corps front.
The new sector was held with all three Brigades in line,
each Brigade area being occupied with two battalions in
front trenches, one in Brigade support and one in
Divisional reserve, in positions facing the Hindenburg
line from the neighbourhood of Lagnicourt on the left
to south of the Bapaume-Cambrai Road in the vicinity
of Demicourt on the right. Activity on the enemy's
part was evidently not anticipated in this area, for by this
relief the 56th Division became responsible for a front
of approximately 10,500 yards.</p>

<p>Of this front the 168th Brigade took over the left or
Lagnicourt sector, with Headquarters in dugouts about
half a mile in rear of Lagnicourt, the Headquarters of
the Division being in Frémicourt. This sector faced the
village of Quéant, which was within the defences of the
Hindenburg line. The front line of the left subsector
consisted of a series of platoon posts which were not yet
connected up, numbered respectively C 18/5, C 18/6, C 12/1,
C 12/2, C 12/3 and C 12/4. These posts were the original
battle outpost positions which had been constructed
earlier in the year during the advance towards the Hindenburg
line. No Man's Land here averaged 1000 yards wide,
and though from most of these posts the enemy front line
was invisible owing to the lie of the ground, they were all,
except on the left, unapproachable from our side, except
under cover of darkness. Some 500 yards in rear of this
chain of defences ran a continuous trench known as the
intermediate line, well constructed, with deep dugouts,
moderately strong wire and a good field of fire. Battalion
Headquarters were in dugouts in the sunken road on the
left of Lagnicourt, and were connected with the intermediate
line by a communication trench called Dunelm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
Avenue. Forward of the intermediate line there was but
one trench leading to the advanced positions and this,
Wakefield Avenue, connected with Post C 18/6.</p>

<p>In this area the Battalion settled down very comfortably
to a period of two months' routine work in and out
of the trenches, unbroken by operations of any interest,
and happily almost entirely free from casualties. In order
to avoid the tedium of following closely the common round
of duty we propose to deal with these months by means
of a few general remarks on the life of the Battalion.</p>

<p>During this period the Battalion was joined by the
following officers:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Capt. E. E. Spicer, Lieuts. A. Bath and A. M. Duthie, and
2/Lieut. E. L. Mills.</p></div>

<p>and by the following attached officers:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>2/Lieuts. W. Shand, E. Petrie, C. W. Rowlands, and E. A.
Ratcliffe (1st Londons).</p>

<p>2/Lieut. A. Franks (6th Londons).</p>

<p>2/Lieut. W. H. Eastoe (7th Londons).</p>

<p>2/Lieuts. E. L. Stuckey, C. S. Richards and A. B. Creighton
(17th Londons).</p>

<p>2/Lieuts. F. Barnes, F. S. C. Taylor, R. S. B. Simmonds, J. L.
Backhouse and E. D. Buckland (20th Londons).</p></div>

<p>Tours of duty were six-day periods as follows:</p>

<div class="center">

  </tr>
</table></div>

<p>The transport lines and Quartermaster's stores were
at Frémicourt, where permanent horse standings, kitchens,
butcher's shop and stores were erected on an elaborate
scale, which appeared to suggest that all ranks were quite
prepared to settle down permanently in this unusually
pleasant sector.</p>

<p>In the line a very considerable amount of work was
got through during September and October. The front
line posts were linked up by a continuous traversed trench,
about 7 feet deep and 3 feet wide at the bottom, and pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>vided
with "baby elephant" shelters for the garrison.
Two embryo trenches in which forward company headquarters
were situate&mdash;Whitley and York supports&mdash;were
extended and strengthened and the intermediate line was
maintained. In addition a large amount of additional
wire was put out.</p>

<p>While in Brigade support the Battalion always occupied
shelters in the sunken roads which ran parallel to the
lines each side of Lagnicourt village, B and D Companies
being on the north side and A and C Companies and
Battalion Headquarters on the south. The dwellings here
were much improved, and fresh ones were constructed,
of which the best were one built under the supervision of
Lieut. Bath and "Twin Villa" by Headquarters. Not all
the Battalion's time, however, was devoted to the adornment
of its own homes, for the support battalion was
invariably called upon to supply heavy working parties,
the largest of which were digging under the R.E.'s, while
others were attached to tunnelling companies for the
construction of additional deep dugouts at trench headquarters
and in the intermediate line.</p>

<p>Training was not overlooked, and a great deal of valuable
work was effected. In particular mention should be
made of the signallers, who attained a very high pitch
of proficiency under Lieut. Gray, while Sergt. Randall
achieved much success with the Lewis gunners, and
Sergts. Oakely and Taylor did very good work with
bombers and rifle grenadiers.</p>

<p>In the line the enemy's activity on the Battalion's
front was slight and confined to occasioned shelling and
trench mortaring, of which the bulk occurred at night.
The sectors right and left of the Battalion came in for a
rather greater share of the enemy's hatred. The London
Scottish on the right were immediately opposed to a
network of trenches sapped out from the Hindenburg
front line, known as the Quéant Birdcage, and in this
vicinity a certain degree of bickering was always in progress,
in the course of which IV Corps developed a pleasing
habit of discharging gas projectors&mdash;about 600 at a time&mdash;against
the Birdcage. The Bosche, however, did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
retaliate. It should not, however, be supposed that the
Division had settled down for a prolonged rest in this
quiet sector. Day and night our excellent artillery were
searching for&mdash;and finding&mdash;the enemy's "weak spots,"
and up and down the sector No Man's Land was every
night the scene of very great patrolling activity. In this
direction really useful work was effected by the Battalion
Scouts under Lieut. O. D. Garratt, M.C., and Sergts.
Housden and Hayes.</p>

<p>The great width of No Man's Land facilitated the
operation of a novel method of supplying the Battalion
when in trenches with rations and stores. The limbers
came up nightly as usual from transport lines at Frémicourt
to trench headquarters at Lagnicourt, and from
this point the rations were sent up to company headquarters
in half limbers and on pack mules; whereby a
considerable saving of troops for work elsewhere was
effected. On one of these nightly journeys a bridge over
Wakefield Avenue broke and precipitated an elderly
transport horse, named Tommy, on to his back in the
trench. It was two hours' hard work to dig room round
him to get him up and make a ramp for him to walk out
of the trench! Tommy's mishap was commemorated
in the new bridge which was named Horsefall Bridge.</p>

<p>A nasty accident in the line was averted by the
coolness of Pte. Bunker, A Company. While a section
was cleaning some Mills bombs one of the pins fell out
and the bomb, with the fuse burning, fell among the men.
Bunker picked it up and threw it out of the trench, when it
at once exploded. For this action Bunker was awarded
the M.S.M.</p>

<p>In the first week of October, while the Battalion was
in line, a series of heavy explosions was heard behind the
enemy line in the vicinity of Quéant and Pronville and
these, combined with the sudden disappearance one night
of Baralle chimney&mdash;a well-known observation point in
the enemy's country&mdash;conduced to the belief, which held
sway for a few days, that a further Bosche retirement
was imminent. This, of course, did not materialise.</p>

<p>Although we are not recording the actions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
Divisional Artillery we may, perhaps, be pardoned for
quoting the following crisp little record from the Divisional
Intelligence Summary as illustrating how well the infantry
was served by its guns. The incident occurred on the
10th October:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Movement was seen at an O.P. or sentry post about
D.7.d.4.6. An 18-pr. opened fire, but the first shot
fell a few yards wide, whereupon the German observer
waved a "washout" signal with a piece of white paper.
The second shot, however, altered his opinion of our
artillery.</p></div>

<p>His amended opinion has, unfortunately, not been recorded.</p>

<p>The losses of the Battalion in personnel up to the end
of October were practically nil, this being accounted for
by the vastness of the terrain and the fact that about
450 men were occupying some 5000 yards of firing and
communication trench. On the 28th October, however,
the Battalion had the misfortune to lose two promising
young officers, 2/Lieuts. Elders and Barnes, both of whom
were killed by shells during an enemy shoot on Posts C 12/3
and C 12/4.</p>

<p>During this period also the Battalion sustained a great
loss in Regimental Sergt.-Major M. Harris, who took his
discharge after nearly twenty-three years of soldiering
in the Royal Fusiliers and the 4th Londons. Sergt.-Major
Harris had served continuously with the 1/4th
Battalion since mobilisation, and had filled the position
of Senior Warrant Officer with conspicuous success since
March 1915. The last member of the pre-war permanent
staff to remain on active service with the Battalion,
Harris' imperturbable geniality was the means of adding
enormous force to his disciplinary strictness. His share
in achieving the Battalion's efficiency can hardly be over-rated,
while his kindly personality was ever a factor in
the social life of the Battalion. Harris was gazetted
Lieutenant and Quartermaster to the Battalion in the
reconstituted Territorial Army in July 1921. The duties
of R.S.M. in the 1/4th Battalion were taken by C.S.M.
Jacques.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of October information was circulated
among commanding officers that active operations were
imminent. The secrets of the operations were jealously
guarded, and only a vague idea was given as to what
would be the opening day. On the 10th November,
however, orders were issued for a feint attack to be delivered
by the 56th Division, which would be on the left
of the main operation. This feint was to be accompanied
by a heavy bombardment by all available batteries, by
a smoke screen and the display of dummy figures over
the parapet. Dummy tanks were also to be erected in
No Man's Land, and the illusion completed&mdash;or anyway
increased&mdash;by running motor cycle engines in the front
line trenches. Arrangements for this demonstration were
pushed on with vigour, and it was understood that Z day
would fall during the Battalion's occupancy of the line.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 18th, however, the 167th Brigade
extended to its left, taking over the 168th sector, and thus
holding a two-brigade front. The 168th Brigade was
concentrated in close billets in Frémicourt and Beugny,
the Battalion being in the former village.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The preparations for the offensive were conducted
with the greatest possible secrecy, and in order to secure
the maximum surprise effect it was arranged for the
attack to be delivered without any preliminary bombardment
or even registration of batteries, the road into the
enemy's defences being cleared instead by a vast number
of tanks.</p>

<p>The attack was delivered by the IV (Woollcombe)
III (Pulteney) and VII (Snow) Corps, on a six-mile front,
between Hermies and Gonnelieu, a subsidiary operation
being conducted north of Bullecourt by the VI Corps
(Haldane). The 56th Division was thus outside the
actual area of advance, but was to co-operate on the
opening day by means of the feint attack, for which it had
already made preparations, and its further action was to
depend on the success gained in the main operation. The
left flank of the area of advance was intersected by the
Canal du Nord, running between Bourlon and Mœuvres.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
The frontage in this region was taken up by the 36th
(Ulster) Division, which adjoined the right flank of the
56th and was the left of the whole attack. The 36th
was to attack with two brigades east of the Canal and one
brigade west, the Division moving northwards along the
Hindenburg system towards Mœuvres. The rôle of the
56th Division was to depend on the degree of success
attained by the 36th. If the latter's attack succeeded
in forcing the retirement of the enemy west of the Canal,
this area would be occupied by the brigade of the 36th
Division which was on the west bank; if, however, this
success was not achieved the 56th Division was to attack
over the open with tanks, the 169th Brigade advancing
on a front between Mœuvres and Tadpole Copse, and the
167th forming a defensive flank from the Copse to our
present front line.</p>

<p>The enormous success which attended the initial stages
of the Cambrai battle needs no elaboration here. At
6.30 a.m. on 30th November the dead silence was suddenly
broken by the roar of a very great concentration of
batteries of all calibres up to 15-inch, and preceded by
380 tanks the assaulting divisions swept over the first
and second systems of the Hindenburg line.</p>

<p>With the exception of a check due to the destruction
of the Canal de l'Escaut Bridge at Masnières, and of
another at Flesquières (where a most gallant resistance
to the 51st Division was put up by a single German
officer, who continued to serve his gun after all the team
were killed and succeeded in knocking out several tanks),
the success of the day was considerable. The villages
of Havrincourt, Graincourt, Ribecourt, Marcoing and La
Vacquerie were added to the British territory, and it was
obvious that the surprise effect had been complete.</p>

<p>On the left the 36th Division established itself north
of the Cambrai Road, astride the Hindenburg line, and the
169th Brigade swung its right flank northward to conform
to its neighbours' movements.</p>

<p>The following day at an early hour the Flesquières
obstacle was overcome and the British line swept forward,
the villages of Masnières, Noyelles, Cantaing and Anneux<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
being added to the bag, while on the left Fontaine-Notre-Dame
was entered and the line pushed up to the southern
edge of Bourlon Wood. On the left of the 36th the 169th
Brigade kept pace, one of their battalions occupying the
first Hindenburg trench about one of the roads forming
the south-west exit of Mœuvres, and beginning to bomb
northwards.</p>

<p>The 21st November witnessed a further deep inroad into
the Hindenburg system. The 36th Division succeeded
during the morning in penetrating into Mœuvres but were
not able to maintain their position. On the extreme left
the 169th Brigade continued their bombing attacks along
the enemy trenches, and were reported in the late afternoon
as having captured Tadpole Copse and the first and second
Hindenburg trenches beyond it as far as the Inchy Road.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the Battalion at Frémicourt the 20th November
passed without incident, but all ranks awaited anxiously
news of the battle, and for the expected orders to move
forward and join in the success. No movement was made,
however, and the day passed slowly, as such days of keen
expectancy always do.</p>

<p>The hour for general action by the 56th Division was
approaching, and the 1/4th Londons received orders at
3.30 p.m. on the 21st to move forward with transport and
stores to Lebucquière, which was reached at 8.15 p.m.,
accommodation being provided in Cinema Camp. The
Battalion was now prepared for action, and the nucleus
personnel under Major Phillips, the second in command
(attached from Montgomery Yeomanry), remained at
Frémicourt.</p>

<p>Next morning the Battalion made all preparations for
an early participation in the fight and, in order to save
fatigue to the men, all battle impedimenta such as Lewis
guns and magazines, bombs, tools and wire cutters were
sent on limbers to an open space near Doignies.</p>

<p>Shortly after midday the Battalion followed, arriving
at Doignies at 4 p.m., picking up its stores and bivouacking.
In the meantime Lieut.-Col. Marchment, M.C., accompanied
by Capt. Maloney, the doctor, rode forward to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
ascertain the situation from the London Scottish, who
were holding the old British front line opposite Tadpole
Copse.</p>

<p>The rain, which had started early in the day, was
still falling when the Battalion arrived at Doignies. The
village was a good deal knocked about, but shelter of a
sort was found, and the Battalion was just well off to
sleep when it was turned out again to move nearer the
line for the purpose of taking over the British front line
from the London Scottish early next day. About midnight
the Battalion got under way in pitch darkness, and
moving through Louverval reached its assembly area
near Piccadilly and about 500 yards in rear of the line by
4.10 a.m. on the 23rd November. As soon as the growing
daylight permitted, companies resumed their advance and
took over Rook, Rabbit and Herring Trenches from the
London Scottish, Headquarters occupying a sunken road
north of the wood surrounding Louverval Château. On
relief the assaulting companies of the London Scottish
moved forward to continue the bombing attack started
by the 169th Brigade.</p>

<p>News of the operation was slow in coming through, but
by 10.17 a.m. a report reached Brigade that the attackers
had been checked on endeavouring to emerge from
Tadpole Copse. This check was due to a peculiar omission
in the British trench maps, which had shown Tadpole Copse
on the crest of a spur, and dominating all the ground in
its immediate vicinity. It was found that between the
Copse and the Inchy Road was a narrow and sharply
marked depression bordered by the declivitous banks
which abound in this undulating countryside. Beyond
this unsuspected valley the Inchy Road was on an eminence
just as prominent as the Tadpole Copse hill; and this
position, held by the enemy in great strength, enabled
them to overlook completely all the northern exits from
the Copse. This valley, which played an important part
in the course of the battle, was found subsequently to be
correctly marked on German maps which were captured
during the action.</p>

<p>After a stubborn fight the London Scottish overcame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
this obstacle and pushed home their attack in the Hindenburg
front trench almost as far as Adelaide Street and
in the support 100 yards beyond the Inchy Road;
while a subsidiary attempt was made, without success, to
capture the Factory between this point and Inchy. At
these points the enemy had constructed blocks which he
held strongly against all attempts to dislodge him. In
the meantime the 169th Brigade had been bombing up the
communications leading back to the second system of the
Hindenburg lines, with the object of isolating Mœuvres,
but the resistance met with here was exceedingly stubborn.</p>

<p>About 8 o'clock that night the enemy launched a
heavy attack against the London Scottish barricades, and
in the support trench they succeeded in forcing the
Scottish back to the Inchy Road, though the position in
the front trench was held. The Scottish had now been
fighting for over twelve hours and had suffered rather
serious losses, and the German counter-attack caused two
companies of the 1/4th Londons to be drawn into the fight,
A Company (Franks) and C (Barkworth) moving forward
to reinforce the Scottish at about 8.30 p.m.</p>

<p>A Company, which advanced first, took up a position,
acting under the orders of Lieut.-Col. Jackson of the
London Scottish, in the old German outpost line outside
Tadpole Copse, while No. 1 Platoon (Ballance) went
forward to reinforce the Scottish company in the front
Hindenburg trench. Affairs having quieted down the
services of this platoon were not immediately necessary,
and it shortly afterwards rejoined the company. In the
meantime No. 2 Platoon (Creighton) was sent to reinforce
the Scottish at the bombing block in the support trench,
and while here Corpl. Johnson and Pte. Bendelow succeeded
in beating off an enemy attack.</p>

<p>C Company, which also took up a preliminary position
in the old German outpost line, was first told off to
replenish the supply of bombs from the brigade dump in
Houndsditch. The fresh supplies were carried to London
Scottish Headquarters; and this task completed, the
company occupied the rectangular work in the support
trench to the east of Tadpole Copse, a portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
second Hindenburg trench in rear of the Copse, and the
communication trench connecting it with the Hindenburg
third line, 2/Lieut. Mills being responsible for this communication
trench and the advanced block about 250
yards along it. 2/Lieut. Stuckey occupied the main
trench. These latter trenches were taken over from the
2nd Londons early on the 24th.</p>

<p>B and D Companies meanwhile had not been idle but
had passed the night providing a covering party to a
company of the Cheshire Pioneers, by whom a chain of
redoubts had been dug in the line selected for the defensive
flank.</p>

<p>At 5.30 a.m. on the 24th B Company (Beeby) moved
forward, also coming under the orders of the London
Scottish, and at first took up a position in support in the
old outpost line outside the Hindenburg system. Almost
immediately the company was ordered forward to relieve
the 2nd Londons in the communication trench leading to
the rear from the Quadrilateral held by C Company.</p>

<p>The morning passed comparatively quietly though the
duty of keeping wicket behind the bombing blocks was a
trying one, which entailed the constant alertness of all
ranks in readiness to meet a sudden emergency. At noon,
however, the enemy put down a heavy barrage on the
captured portions of the Hindenburg trenches, and this
was followed at 2 p.m. by a most determined attack on
the advanced blocks held by the London Scottish. This
met with considerable success, and though the Scottish
fought with gallantry they were overcome by the weight
of the enemy's onslaught, and by 2.45 p.m. the German
bombers had reached the block held by Mills (C Company),
who put up a stout resistance, under orders from his company
commander to hold his post failing further orders.
In this he was helped by the company's Lewis guns, which
gave covering fire to Mills' platoon and the London
Scottish, and also engaged the enemy at the Inchy Road
Factory. Three of the guns were destroyed by the
enemy's shell fire.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>The trench was already uncomfortably filled with
casualties in addition to the men who were keeping up
the fight, but in a few moments the congestion was greatly
increased by the numbers of Scottish troops who began
to come back and file along the trench. At about 3 p.m.
about 50 of the London Scottish were seen to leave the
Hindenburg support trench in the hidden valley referred
to, with the object of making their way over the open
towards the front trench. Realising that this vacation
of the trench might enable the enemy to surge forward
along it and so cut off Mills, who was still holding his
own up the communication trench, Barkworth promptly
ordered Stuckey to advance and form a block beyond the
side trench held by Mills. Stuckey's losses, however, had
been severe, and with only five men at his disposal he was
unable to cope with the task in view of the great congestion
of the trench. Rather than risk the sudden
cutting off of his remaining slender resources in men and
the laying open to the enemy of the whole Tadpole Copse
position, which would inevitably result, Barkworth now
decided to withdraw his advanced positions and concentrate
his company, and accordingly Stuckey was ordered
to block the support trench at the west entrance to the
Quadrilateral, Mills gradually withdrawing and holding
the enemy off till the new block was completed. In this
retired position the remnants of C Company were in
touch with B Company and also with the 2nd Londons,
and here the enemy was finally held up.</p>

<p>This gallant little defence in which C Company put
up a really good fight and inflicted considerable loss on
the enemy, cost it about 40 per cent. of its strength in
casualties and, as already stated, three of its Lewis guns.</p>

<p>At the same time B Company had been heavily engaged
in its communication trench, of which it held a length of
some 250 yards back from the second trench. Here the
enemy, who had a bombing block about 50 yards from
B Company's forward block, began to attack at about
2.30 p.m., but after a struggle his first attempt was thrown
back. A little later the Bosche returned to the charge,
and this time was successful in forcing B Company back
for a short distance, but a determined counter-attack
re-established the position, which, after a third and also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
abortive enemy assault, remained intact in the Company's
hands.</p>

<p>While the 1/4th Londons had been thus heavily engaged
the London Scottish had made a successful resistance
in the front Hindenburg trench which defied all the
enemy's attempts. Towards the evening the enemy's
activity both in shell fire and bombing somewhat lessened,
and at 8.30 p.m. D Company (Duthie) was also sent
forward relieving C Company in the trenches. At the
same time the Rangers took over from the Scottish in
the front trench.</p>

<p>As the fighting on the 24th was somewhat involved, it
seems desirable to restate the positions now held by the
companies of the Battalion in the Hindenburg system:</p>

<div class="hangindent8">

<p>Front Line&mdash;D Company&mdash;Quadrilateral in support trench, and
communication leading up to front trench.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>B Company&mdash;Communication trench leading from
the Quadrilateral back to third trench.</p></div>

<div class="hangindent8">

<p>Support Line&mdash;A and C Companies and Headquarters&mdash;Front
trench from west edge of Tadpole Copse to
communication trench east of it and old German
outpost line in front of the Copse.</p></div>

<p>The 25th November also witnessed very severe fighting
in which the 1/4th Londons bore an important part and
achieved considerable success. The fighting this day fell
to D Company who had not yet been engaged, and the
objective allotted to them was the recapture of the lost
portion of the Hindenburg support trench as far as its
junction with the communication trench, which had been
defended by Mills the previous day. At the same time
the Rangers were to make good the two communication
trenches leading back from the front trench to the support
on the east side of the Inchy Road, and also the support
trench in prolongation of Duthie's attack.</p>

<p>We propose to narrate this gallant little action of D
Company in the words of Duthie's report on the operation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Artillery preparation began at 12.30 p.m. It was
reported to be very short on our right. Our two
blocks were removed at 12.45 p.m. At Zero (1 p.m.)
the attack commenced. The Company was disposed
as follows:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
<p>14 Platoon, 2/Lieut. E. Petrie, Bombers, Rifle
Grenadiers, Riflemen (carrying); 13 Platoon, 2/Lieut.
C. W. Rowlands, with sections in same order.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Lewis
gun sections took up a position near our blocks so as
to fire along the trench and to prevent any movement
in the open. Company Headquarters moved with the
leading platoon. For about 50 yards very little opposition
was met with but the leading bombing section was
then held up by stick bombs and suffered eight casualties,
which included the leading bombers. To overcome
this check fire was opened for several minutes
with No. 23 and No. 24 Rifle Grenades, and the trench
was searched forward for about 100 yards. The
shooting was very accurate and the enemy were driven
back with the loss of about 5 men killed. The advance
was continued by bounds of from 20 to 40 yards under
cover of salvoes of rifle grenades. The first two deep
dugouts were unoccupied. The third and fourth were
not immediately searched but sentries were posted.
It was thought that some of the C Company men who
had been wounded the previous day might still be
down there. The small C.T. (about 100 yards from
the Quadrilateral) was blocked about 120 yards up.
At the entrance a good deal of bombing was overcome.
This is a shallow trench and the far end under water.
Further delay was caused by the third and fourth
dugouts which were found to contain 21 of the enemy.
These were finally cleared. Several were killed and
the remainder badly wounded and captured. The
company then pushed forward to trench junction at
E 13 c. 15.75 (objective) and reached it about 2.45 p.m.
The Lewis gun sections were brought up and placed
in suitable positions to protect a further advance
and also the blocking party in the small C.T. None
of the Rangers were encountered and the trench
appeared unoccupied, but bombing was thought to
be heard about 300 yards further along.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Companies were still organised in two platoons owing to their
reduced strength, which had not been made good since the third battle
of Ypres.</p></div>

<p>A small block was made in this trench about
30 yards from the junction. The enemy was now
observed leaving the trench and crawling over the
open towards the bank at D 18 d. 90.98 (in the unsuspected
valley). Heavy rifle fire was opened and
at least 30 of the enemy killed. Few, if any, got over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>the bank. As the trench beyond the objective
appeared to be unoccupied a party of 12 including
O.C. Company, 2/Lieut. Rowlands, Sergts. Norris
and Arklay, moved on up the trench. No fire was
opened and silence was maintained. In the next bay
past the trench at E 13 c. 00.85 (50 yards beyond the
objective) two men were seen firing a machine-gun
which was mounted on the parapet and aimed down
the bank (in the valley). This was rushed.... The
gun was dismounted and brought in. Other guns
were heard firing and two more were seen (at points
farther along the trench in the valley described in
the report by map reference). Two parties under
Sergts. Norris and Arklay moved round to a point
from which fire could be brought to bear. The crews
of two men to each gun were killed and the guns
brought in. O.C. Company and Sergt. Norris continued
to advance along the trench and up to the
top of the bank. Heavy bombing could be seen in
Tadpole Lane and in the front line towards the Inchy
Road. Further advance was prevented by the fire of
our own guns firing on the trench in response to S.O.S.
signal which had been sent up from the front line.
The trench was very full of dead, both of the London
Scottish and of the enemy. It was impossible to
walk without treading on them. As our barrage
continued the party moved back to our original
objective and blocks were made at this trench
junction. The remainder of the party carried back
four wounded London Scottish, who were found in the
open near the bank. Later in the evening when
our barrage was discontinued an attack was made on
our block. The enemy was quickly silenced. At
11 p.m. D Company were relieved by A Company.</p></div>

<p>A very successful operation, and a modest account of
it by Duthie, whose personality and leadership was an
important factor in the result achieved. The two men
in charge of the first gun captured were shot by Duthie
with his revolver. The resistance offered to the Rangers
was stubborn, and but for their inability to advance it is
possible a considerable success might have been achieved,
since the barrage put down by our guns, in response to
the Rangers' S.O.S., had the effect of shelling Duthie out
of part of his gains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>

<p>The remainder of the day was inactive, no further
fighting taking place till about 11.30 a.m. on the 26th,
when once more the enemy attempted to force B Company's
position in the communication trench. The company,
however, repeated its gallantry of the former occasion, and
the enemy retired later without having gained any success.</p>

<p>At 11.30 p.m. on the 26th the Battalion was relieved
by the Kensingtons, withdrawing on relief to its former
position in the Brigade support area behind the old British
front line. This relief brought to a close the Battalion's
active participation in the British offensive, which was
now practically spent. During the very trying three
days spent behind the bombing blocks in circumstances
which required particular vigilance and fortitude, all ranks
had behaved splendidly, and it is difficult to mention
individuals when all had rendered such excellent service.
A few names, however, call for outstanding mention,
among these being Capt. S. J. Barkworth, M.C., M.M., and
Capt. A. M. Duthie, the commanders of C and D Companies,
on whom the brunt of the work had fallen, and
their subalterns Rowlands and Mills. The Padre, the
Rev. S. F. Leighton Green, did splendid service throughout,
being always about the Hindenburg lines and going up to
the advanced blocks. At night he was constantly visiting
and helping with casualties and administering the last
rites to those who had fallen.</p>

<p>The whole action as far as the Division was concerned
had developed on lines completely opposed to the original
plans; for whereas it had been proposed to employ the
Division in the open with tanks, its fighting throughout
had been hand-to-hand fighting in trenches. The
regularity and sufficiency with which bomb supplies found
their way to the front indicated excellent organisation.
At no time did supplies fall short of the demand.</p>

<p>It was a surprise to a good many to find the much
vaunted Hindenburg line inferior to our own defences. The
outpost line which the companies first occupied was a gross
delusion, for it was only six inches deep, while the main
line was poor and not over well maintained, and the Bosche
ideas of sanitation could only be described as a scandal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p>The casualties sustained during the three days' fighting
were light in view of the close contact with the enemy.
Two officers, 2/Lieuts. R. S. B. Simmonds and E. Petrie,
were wounded, and the total losses in other ranks amounted
to about 60, including two valuable N.C.O.'s killed, viz.:
Sergts. Barker and Gooch, and one, Sergt. Lintott, M.M.,
wounded and captured.</p>

<p>At midnight on the 24th November the 56th Division
had passed from the IV to the VI Corps. Its position at
the conclusion of the offensive operations was one of
almost dangerous extension. It had captured and was
holding over a mile of the Hindenburg line. Its right
flank was not secure so long as Mœuvres remained in the
enemy's hands; its left flank on the Tadpole Copse spur
was exposed and subject to constant counter-attacks.
Two of its brigades were involved in this fighting and in
holding a defensive flank of 2000 yards, while the remaining
brigade, the 167th, was responsible for a frontage in
the old British line of 5500 yards, and had in addition to
supply a battalion each night for consolidation of the
captured position. It was thus unable to provide relief
for the troops who had been fighting, and was without any
reserve for use in case of emergency. Representations
made by General Dudgeon to the Corps Commander as to
the weakness of his position resulted in a battalion of the
3rd Division being at once placed at the disposal of the
167th Brigade for counter-attack purposes. This temporary
relief was extended a few days later, and by the
29th the whole of the 167th Brigade had been relieved by
troops of the 3rd Division and was withdrawn at Frémicourt
in Divisional reserve, with two of its battalions lent
temporarily to the 168th Brigade.</p>

<p>The three days following relief were spent by the
Battalion in support in providing carrying and working
parties in the front line and burying parties for the fallen.
On the 29th a slight side step to the left was made so
that the Battalion's right flank rested on Piccadilly and it
became responsible for the defensive flank. A considerable
amount of work had been done in this quarter, and the flank
was now provided with a continuous belt of wire and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
chain of inter-supporting posts. A communication trench
had been dug from the old line across No Man's Land
to the Hindenburg line parallel to Piccadilly, a distance
of some 1300 yards, and from this T-head trenches had
been sapped forward facing north. The defensive flank
positions were only occupied at night, the trench garrison
taking two companies, A and B, while C and D Companies
provided patrols along the wire to prevent any attempts
of the enemy to turn the position.</p>

<p>The 29th November passed quietly though a good deal
of movement was observable in rear of the enemy's lines,
so that his serious attack of the following day was not
entirely unexpected.</p>

<p>From the Battalion's position an extensive view was
obtainable over the whole terrain as far as Bourlon Wood,
and early on the 30th a strong concentration of the enemy's
forces was clearly visible north and east of Mœuvres.</p>

<p>At 10.45 a.m. the S.O.S. signal went up all along the
line and the enemy attacked in dense formation under a
heavy barrage. The Battalion stood to arms all day but
was not required, for the gallant defence of the units in
the line this day was one of the greatest achievements of
the 56th Division. The enemy's attack was pressed with
vigour and at one time he had driven a wedge into the
Hindenburg lines and divided the London Scottish, who
were still in the line, from the 2nd Londons. The position,
however, was defended tenaciously and at the end of the
day the whole of the Division's gains in the Hindenburg
front line were maintained, while the heaps of enemy
dead outside the trenches testified to the severity of the
check which he had suffered.</p>

<p>That night the Battalion was called on for particularly
active patrolling as it was anticipated that the enemy would
renew his attempt on the Divisional front. The whole
resources of the Division were drawn upon to meet any
renewed enemy action, and Lieut.-Col. Marchment had
under him for defensive purposes, in addition to the
Battalion, a company of the 5th Cheshires, a company of
the 7th Middlesex, the 512th Field Company, R.E., and two
sections of the 416th Field Company, R.E. The Engineers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
were employed in digging fresh redoubts in dead ground
to the rear of the defensive flank line, while the infantry
companies were kept as a reserve at Battalion Headquarters.
No further action occurred until the afternoon
of the 1st December when a fresh concentration of enemy
forces about 3.30 p.m. was crushed by our guns.</p>

<p>The Division had now well earned a rest, and warning
was received on the 1st December that it would be relieved
by the 51st Division immediately. The relief began at
7 p.m. that evening, the Battalion handing over its lines
to the 6th Black Watch. It was evident that the incoming
troops had been pushed forward hurriedly, for
the relieving battalion arrived without Lewis guns or
shrapnel helmets, and with the officers wearing slacks,
just as they had risen from dinner. The relief took a
long while to effect, and it was not until 4 a.m. on the 2nd
that Lieut.-Col. Marchment handed over command of the
sector. On relief the Battalion withdrew to billets in
Beugny, but at 11 a.m. the rearward march was continued
to Beaulencourt which was reached by 4 p.m., quarters
being allotted in the camp that the Battalion had occupied
on the 30th August.</p>

<p>While at Beaulencourt the Battalion received congratulatory
messages which had been issued to Brigade
by the Corps and Divisional commanders on the part
played in the battle.</p>

<p>The following day the Battalion entrained at Frémicourt
for the Arras area, reaching Beaumetz-les-Loges at
12.30 p.m., whence it marched to billets in Simencourt.</p>

<p>The honours awarded for services rendered in the

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

THE 1/4TH BATTALION, WINTER 1917/18--THE
RESERVE BATTALION, 1916/17</h2>


<p>The closing days of 1917 were full of anxiety for the
Allies. The operations at Cambrai had been undertaken
by the British forces at the termination of the prolonged
and unusually trying offensive on the northern ridges at
Ypres, with the object of affording some relief to our
Italian Allies. The secession of Russia from the Allied
cause had had a most serious effect in all theatres of war.
In the East it had afforded the tottering Austrian Empire
the respite it so badly needed and had wrought the utter
downfall of isolated Roumania, besides giving a severe
check to the Allies' aspirations in the Balkans and Palestine.
In the West it had entailed a complete reversal of the
numerical position, and from the end of November
onwards the German strength was being continually
augmented by the arrival of divisions from the Russian
front, while the Allies became subjected to an ever-increasing
strain. The growing requirements of all the
battlefields of the world on which the Empire's soldiers
were playing their part made it impossible to maintain
the British forces in France at the strength necessary to
combat the threat of a very serious German offensive.
Only from the Far West was any relief for the Allies to be
expected. The American Army which had been about
ten months in training was already being transferred to
France, but it would still be some time before it would
be sufficiently numerous or experienced to turn the scale
against the enemy. As the winter wore on the threat of
an enemy attack on a grand scale developed into a
probability, which as all the world now knows, materialised
on the 21st March 1918.</p>

<p>For some weeks, however, prior to the launching of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
this final effort of the Central Powers the Allies had
definitely passed to the defensive in preparation for the
German onslaught, and our present task is to bridge
rapidly the gulf between the close of active operations at
the end of 1917 and the point, which we will fix in the
early days of March 1918, at which we can conveniently
take up the story of the regiment in the offensive
itself. We propose, therefore, to devote a few pages to
bringing up to date the record of the various activities
of the regiment, dealing first with the 1/4th Battalion
in France, and afterwards with the Reserve Battalion
at home.</p>


<h3>I. <em>The 1/4th Battalion in Artois</em></h3>

<p>After three months in the devastated area around
Lagnicourt, where the Battalion had been entirely removed
from French civilisation, and where scarcely any had
had the opportunity of sleeping under a proper roof, the
billets allotted to the troops at Simencourt on the 3rd
December were a great treat, and it was hoped that for
at least a few days the Battalion would be permitted to
enjoy its well-earned rest. On this occasion as on most
others, however, the Divisional rest proved a delusion,
and after two days occupied in cleaning and reorganisation
the Battalion found itself once more on the road, for
on the 5th it marched from Simencourt at 9.30 a.m. to
Wakefield Camp, near Roclincourt (three miles north of
Arras) in the First Army area.</p>

<p>The Division was now allotted to the XIII Corps
(McCracken), which formed the right flank of Horne's
First Army and comprised in addition to the 56th, the
31st and 62nd Divisions.</p>

<p>The following day Lieut.-Col. Marchment and the
Works Officer (Lieut. Lorden) reconnoitred the sector to
be taken over, and on the 7th and 8th the relief of the
94th Brigade (31st Division) by the 168th Brigade took
place, the 1/4th Londons moving on the first day of relief
to Brigade support and on the second day into the left
subsection of the centre Brigade section facing Oppy, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
trenches which it took over from the 12th York and
Lancaster Regiment.</p>

<p>The whole area had seen a great deal of heavy fighting
since the early days of the War. In May and June 1915
during Sir John French's offensive at Festubert, the
French troops had attacked Notre Dame de Lorette,
Ablain St Nazaire, La Targette and Neuville St Vaast.
Early in 1916 the Allied positions on the Vimy Ridge, by
then held by the British, had been heavily attacked by
the enemy; while in the spring of 1917, in conjunction
with the Third Army's operations east of Arras, the
Canadian Corps had swept over the Vimy Ridge and down
the slopes beyond towards the broad plains of Douai,
carrying the line in front of Gavrelle and Arleux-en-Gohelle.
The British front line at the end of 1917 was
therefore deep in what had originally been a rear German
system of defence; trenches were numerous, but poor and
in bad repair, and the whole ground under numerous
intense bombardments had been badly "crumped."</p>

<p>The Battalion's sector lay between Arleux and Gavrelle
and passed through Oppy Wood, a leafless spectre of what
had once been a copse, through whose shattered trunks
the remains of Oppy and Neuvireuil were visible. The
forward line was held in three posts, known from right to
left as Beatty, Wood and Oppy. Each post took a
company, with one platoon of each company in the
Marquis-Earl line, a continuous trench some four hundred
yards in rear. The fourth company was held in reserve
in Bow Trench about 1700 yards back from the line of
posts, while Battalion Headquarters occupied a dugout
in South Duke Street, close to the Marquis line, which
was the line of resistance.</p>

<p>The second defensive system consisted of the Red line,
a continuous trench in front of Bailleul and Willerval,
while a third system, the Green line, followed the crest of
the Vimy Ridge. The observation throughout the area
was excellent owing to the regular slope eastwards from
the Vimy Ridge, and brigade and battalion commanders
could overlook the whole of their sectors from their
respective Headquarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>The Battalion's sector was served by one main communication
trench, Ouse Alley, which started from the
Green line no less than 5300 yards from the front line.
The administrative arrangements were distinctly good.
Steam trains ran to daylight railhead in rear of the Green
line, and this was connected with the Red line by a
night service of petrol-electric trains. From the Red
line forwards rations and stores were moved by truck.
Battalion Headquarters also enjoyed the luxury of having
water laid on by pipe line. Having said so much, however,
we have almost exhausted the good points of the sector.
The defences themselves left much to be desired. An
early reconnaissance of the wire in front of the three
company posts revealed an alarming weakness, for the
single lines of concertina wire afforded but little obstacle
to an enterprising enemy, and were placed out much too
close to our parapets. The trenches, with the exception
of the Red line, which was of good construction, were
shallow and much knocked about.</p>

<p>The Battalion's first tour in this sector passed without
incident, the enemy being rather surprisingly inactive,
and the Battalion was able to make much progress
towards remedying the defects in its defences. On the
13th December it handed over its lines to the Rangers
and withdrew to Divisional reserve in Springvale Camp
at Ecurie, a pleasant camp, but one of the filthiest the
Battalion had ever had to occupy.</p>

<p>A few days were spent in training here, and on Sunday,
the 16th, Major-Gen. Dudgeon attended the Battalion's
Church Parade, and presented medal ribands to all available
N.C.O.'s and men who had been decorated for their services
at Cambrai. The Division was now expecting relief by
the 31st, and, as this relief would have ensured a Christmas
out of the line, considerable disappointment was caused to
all ranks by the announcement on the 17th December that
the relief was cancelled temporarily, and that the Battalion
was to return to the trenches. The change took place the
following day, and the 1/4th Londons took over the Oppy
sector from the Rangers.</p>

<p>Five uneventful days passed in the Oppy trenches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
On the whole the enemy displayed little activity beyond
occasional retaliation to our continuous and systematic
bombardments, which were by day and night directed
against the enemy's "weak spots." At night the Bosche
showed signs of considerable nervousness. A good deal
of progress was made with the Brigade programme of
trench and wiring work, which was carried on in intensely
cold weather, and on the 23rd the Battalion once more
exchanged with the Rangers and withdrew to Brigade
support.</p>

<p>In the support area Headquarters and B Company
(Spicer) were in a 30-foot railway cutting in rear of Bailleul,
while A (H. N. Williams), C (Barkworth) and D (Cooper)
were in the Red line. Christmas day, which was fortunately
not marked by hostile activity, was spent in
these positions and by means of numerous small parties
in the Red line the troops were able to get as much
enjoyment out of it as the circumstances permitted, but
the festivity was rather damped by the death of 2/Lieut.
E. L. Stuckey, a keen and promising officer, who was
killed by a stray shell in the Red line.</p>

<p>Late on Christmas evening the enemy carried out a
hurricane bombardment on the front line posts, and
during the last day of the year showed some disposition
to increase his harassing fire on our back areas.</p>

<p>On the 28th December the 167th Brigade relieved the
168th, which withdrew in Divisional reserve to the Marœuil
area, the Battalion being billeted at St Aubin, where five
days of training and refitting were obtained. The New
Year was celebrated by carrying out the arrangements
which had originally been made for Christmas, and after
a quite pleasant interlude the Battalion moved on the
3rd January 1918, into the right sector of the Divisional
front at Gavrelle, relieving the Queen's Westminsters.
The weather was now intensely cold and the ground was
covered with snow, which effectively stopped any attempts
at active work. The tour of duty passed quietly and
without any casualties, though the enemy's artillery and
trench mortar fire continued to show an increase in
volume, and on both sides aircraft activity developed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>The 62nd Division now took over the Division's sector,
and on the 6th January the 56th Division passed into
G.H.Q. reserve at forty-eight hours' notice to move.
The Battalion handed over its trenches to the 2/4th
K.O.Y.L.I. and moved to billets at Marœuil, continuing
its route on the 7th to Monchy-Breton (near St Pol),
where it arrived in billets at 4 p.m.</p>

<p>A great deal of useful training was carried out at
Monchy-Breton, but the incident which probably did as
much good to the Battalion as any, was the formation by
Lieut. Faulkner, the quartermaster, of an orchestra which
was an enormous success from its inception, and maintained
its reputation until the end of the War. The
orchestra included the following:</p>

<div class="center">

    <td>'Cellos</td>
    <td>Ptes. Montague and Stone.</td>

    <td>Pte. Smith.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Harmonium</td>
    <td>L.-Corpl. Weekes.</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

<p>The numerous concerts given by this excellent band,
which was really well trained by the quartermaster,
afforded real pleasure, not only to the Battalion and to
other units of the Division, but also to the French inhabitants
of the various villages in which the Battalion
found temporary homes.</p>

<p>During December and January the Battalion was
joined by 2/Lieuts. H. T. Hannay and H. O. Morris, and
by 2/Lieut. A. E. Hanks (13th Londons), while Capt.
G. E. Stanbridge was granted an exchange to England
for six months' duty at home, after having been in
France since March 1916.</p>

<p>By this time the possibilities of a German offensive
had developed into a practical certainty, and all training
was directed towards methods of defence and counter-attack.
Much attention was paid to musketry and Lewis
gun training. The importance of the rifle and bayonet
as the infantry weapon <i lang="fr">par excellence</i> was once more
being realised, and the bomb and rifle grenade, which in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
1916 and 1917 had to a large extent ousted the rifle from
its proper function, were again recognised to be only
subsidiary aids in certain circumstances, so that full
advantage was eagerly taken of the chance to ensure
that all ranks were "handy" with their rifles.</p>

<p>The defensive systems in the area lately occupied by
the Division still needed a vast amount of work to bring
them to a condition to resist a serious attack, and accordingly
throughout the period spent in G.H.Q. reserve each
brigade of the Division supplied one battalion for work
in the forward area under the Chief Engineer XIII Corps.
The Battalion's turn for this duty came after seventeen
days of training at Monchy-Breton, and on the 24th
January it moved forward, railing from Tincques to
Ecurie, and was accommodated at Stewart Camp, Roclincourt,
the transport lines being stationed at Marœuil.
Every available man was now put to work in one or other
of the large parties which were supplied daily for the
R.E.'s, the principal tasks which fell to the Battalion's
lot being the wiring of the Green line and the construction
of cable trenches (<em>i.e.</em> narrow deep trenches in which
telegraph cables were buried to minimise the risk of their
destruction by shell fire) in the forward area by night.
The severity of the winter had now given place to thaw;
the weather was warm for the time of year and a good
deal of rain fell.</p>

<p>This duty continued till the end of January, when
the Battalion was relieved and returned to the reserve
area by train from Ecurie to Tincques, marching thence
to billets at Magnicourt, which were reached on the
1st February.</p>

<p>An extensive reorganisation was now effected throughout
the British armies in France. The ever-dwindling
supply of reinforcements from home, due in part to failing
resources in man-power and partly to the retention in
England of large defence forces which were held in readiness
against a possible German invasion, had caused the
numbers in infantry battalions throughout the Army to
sink dangerously below full strength. In the 1/4th
Londons the casualties of Ypres and Cambrai in 1917 had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
never been balanced by reinforcements, and this was
typical of the condition of affairs in every unit which had
been heavily engaged in the preceding six months. The
decision arrived at, therefore, was to reduce all Brigades
to a three, instead of a four, battalion establishment,
and this was carried out by disbanding one battalion per
brigade and dividing out its strength among the three
battalions which were retained. Inevitably such drastic
action caused bitter disappointment among the battalions
which had the misfortune to be selected for disbandment,
and <i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> received temporarily a severe check.
In the 56th Division the 3rd (Royal Fusiliers), 9th (Queen
Victoria's) and 12th (Rangers) Battalions were reduced
to cadre strength and transferred to the 58th Division, so
that from the beginning of the month of February 1918
the infantry of the Division consisted of:</p>

</table></div>

<p>The Battalion received through these changes about
150 N.C.O.'s and men from the 9th Londons, 50 from the
3rd Londons and 60 from the 2/1st Londons, who had
been disbanded from the 58th Division. Four subalterns
also came to the Battalion as follows: Lieuts. G. G. Lewis
and F. G. Athey from 2/1st Londons, H. F. Dade from
3rd Londons and W. G. Hook from 9th Londons. The
new arrivals naturally felt sore at first at the disappearance
of their own units, but, being all good sportsmen, accepted
the inevitable, and rapidly settled down in the 1/4th
Battalion. This acquisition of strength enabled the
Battalion organisation of companies to be expanded to
a three-platoon basis instead of the two-platoon system
which had been in force since August 1917.</p>

<p>At Magnicourt a week's useful training was effected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
in which the reorganisation necessary in consequence of
the above changes figured largely. The Battalion was
joined by 2/Lieuts. R. E. Campkin, C. H. Board, T. H.
Mawby and G. R. Pitman.</p>

<p>The morale of the Battalion&mdash;as indeed of all units
of the Division&mdash;was now splendid. All ranks were perfectly
confident as to the outcome of the approaching
offensive and the competitive spirit between companies,
always strong, was fostered in every possible way. The
Battalion transport under Lieut. G. V. Lawrie, M.C., also
maintained high efficiency, and received special commendation
from Gen. Dudgeon for the smartness of its
turn-out. Amid strenuous work amusements were not
overlooked and the pleasures of the lighter side of life were
much added to by the extraordinarily good concert given
one evening by the Quartermaster's band.</p>

<p>At the end of the first week of February the 56th
Division's period in reserve was brought to a close and
its relief of the 62nd Division began. On the 9th the
Battalion left Magnicourt and marched to Marœuil, moving
forward again the next day to its old trenches at Oppy,
where it relieved the 2/5th West Yorkshires. In addition
to its old sector the Battalion had to take over, as a
temporary measure, Bird Post on the right. The front
line posts were not approachable by daylight at this date
as Boyne and Bedford Streets, the communication trenches
leading forward from the Marquis line, had fallen in as
a result of the severe weather, and had not been repaired.
Other parts of the trench system also needed much repair.</p>

<p>This tour of duty was remarkably quiet, and with the
exception of sporadic shelling the enemy was inactive.
The Bosche had apparently been permitted to contract a
habit of walking about in the open in rear of his lines,
but B and C Companies in Bird and Beatty posts were
soon able to bring home to him the unwisdom of exposing
himself in daylight. The Headquarter Scouts under Sergt.
Hayes also did good work in this direction from a useful
fire position on a big mound near Beatty Post, whence
by good marksmanship they secured six head one evening.
At this period also the close liaison which the Battalion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
always maintained with the Divisional artillery stood it
in good stead. A battery of the 281st Brigade R.F.A. had
a section of 18-pr. guns in Bailleul, and the Battalion
signallers having run a wire to the guns from Bird Post,
the gunners settled down to a little sniping. The gunner
officer in charge, Lieut. J. Powell, M.C., registered the
guns on a small cart standing in Bosche ground and it was
easy to switch and elevate the guns roughly on to any
party of Bosche moving about. The results were most
successful and the Bosche was finally cured of his desire
for walking exercise outside his trenches.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 14th February the Battalion
handed over its trenches to the London Scottish and withdrew
to billets in Roclincourt in Divisional reserve. Here
nine days were spent, during which the Battalion supplied
working parties for the further improvement of the
trenches.</p>

<p>From the 22nd to the 27th the Battalion was once more
in the trenches for another quiet tour of duty, and on the
latter date it withdrew to Roclincourt West Camp in
Divisional reserve. The lack of activity at this period
is evidenced by the fact that only two men were wounded
during the month of February.</p>

<p>Attention was now fixed solely on the coming offensive,
to meet which preparations were being pushed forward
with thoroughness. Additional firesteps were constructed
in the trenches and the already formidable wire was
further strengthened.</p>

<p>From this date forward every tour in the trenches or
in Brigade support was passed by platoons in exactly the
same position, so that every man might, whenever the
offensive should be launched, be well acquainted with his
position.</p>

<p>The five days at Roclincourt West Camp were succeeded
by a short period in Brigade support, in which
position the Battalion relieved the Kensingtons on the
5th March. The tour of duty passed quietly with the
exception of a somewhat severe enemy bombardment with
gas shell on the evening of the 8th. Early on the morning
of the 9th the Kensingtons carried out an excellent raid on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
the enemy lines north of Oppy, in the course of which
about 20 Germans were killed and 4 brought back as
prisoners. The raiding party was under Lieut. Lester,
M.C. (since killed), commissioned from the 4th Londons.
The identification obtained was normal, that is, the
prisoners belonged to the German regiment which was
believed to be opposed to us. These captures elicited
information that the offensive was imminent, and this,
combined with unmistakable signs of enemy activity, such
as extensive road repairs, clearing and repairing enemy
trenches formerly derelict, and so forth, left no room for
doubt that the Germans' great effort could not be long
delayed. Thenceforward extreme vigilance was exercised
all along the line.</p>


<h3>II. <em>The Reserve Battalion</em></h3>

<p>Shortly after the reconstruction of the 1st London
(Reserve) Brigade, which resulted in the 3rd (Reserve)
Battalion being made the draft-finding unit for both the
3rd and the 4th London Regiments, the Brigade was
moved from its camps at Hurdcott and Fovant to billets
in various watering places on the South Devon coast.
The 3rd Battalion was fortunate enough to be allotted to
Torquay, where it took up its new quarters in December
1916. As a military station Torquay was, of course, not
so desirable as Hurdcott. In the first place, the scattering
of untrained troops in billets greatly increased the difficulty
of disciplinary control, while training grounds were farther
removed and somewhat inadequate. In spite of these
undoubted disadvantages, however, the change from the
bitter searching winds of "The Plain" in winter time to
the more genial climate of South Devon was universally
welcomed, and the Battalion lived for some weeks in
considerable comfort.</p>

<p>The Brigade was now under command of Brig.-Gen.
Howell, who at the outbreak of war had commanded the
Guards on the Somme.</p>

<p>Life in the Reserve Battalion at Torquay proceeded
on very much the same routine as had obtained at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
Hurdcott, and an attempt at describing it in detail would
only be wearisome. Once again the instructional staff
had to face the "spade work" of training raw recruits,
since the drain on the Battalion's resources during the
Somme battles had denuded it of trained soldiers, and a
fresh batch of recruits now filled its ranks.</p>

<p>A further modification in training organisation took
place about this time, and we may refer shortly to this
as it affected the functions of training battalions considerably.
This modification lay in the establishment of
"Command Depôts" which were formed for the reception
from hospital of officers, N.C.O.'s and men returned from
the Expeditionary Force who were not yet physically fit
to return to their respective units. At a stage in their
convalescence, in which their retention in hospital as
in-patients was no longer required, such men were sent to
their Command Depôt for light exercise in walking,
physical training and so on, and for such local treatment
as their individual cases necessitated. N.C.O.'s and men
remained in the Depôt until their recovery was complete,
when they were despatched to their training reserve units
for a short "smartening-up" course of instruction before
being once more sent overseas. The Command Depôts
thus relieved training battalions of a great deal of medical
and convalescent work for which they were neither
equipped nor suitable, and also ensured that the staff of
instructors in the training battalions were engaged for the
minimum of time in "brushing-up" the trained men
prior to their return to France, whereby they were enabled
to devote the maximum of attention to the recruits.
The Guards and the London Regiment were amalgamated
for the purpose of a Command Depôt, and this was located
at Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex. Shortly after its formation,
Major G. H. M. Vine was appointed from the Reserve
Battalion to the Permanent Staff of the Depôt.</p>

<p>In January 1917, Major L. T. Burnett joined the
Reserve Battalion from sick leave and was appointed
second in command, a position which he continued to
fill until the following July, when he was transferred to
the War Office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>The South Devon station was retained for only a comparatively
short period and in April the Brigade moved
again, this time to Blackdown, in the Aldershot Command.
Blackdown is some seven miles north of Aldershot, and
is one of the many pine-and heather-covered hills in
which the district abounds. Most of the barracks at this
Station were hutted camps, but the 3rd Battalion was
fortunate in being sent to Dettingen, a pre-war permanent
barracks in which it was exceedingly comfortable.</p>

<p>The advantage of having the Battalion compacted in
one camp became almost at once exemplified, and the
desirable tightening of discipline rapidly effected a great
increase of efficiency. The unsurpassed facilities for
training afforded by the Aldershot Command also proved
of incalculable value, and enabled the keen and efficient
training staff of the Battalion to raise the unit to the
position of one of the best organised battalions of a
Brigade whose reputation for training was second to none.</p>

<p>At Blackdown, moreover, the facilities provided for
the recreation of the troops were really excellent, and
among these mention should be made first of the Y.M.C.A.
and the Church Army, whose excellent institutions were
of the greatest value. Each battalion also was provided
with a sports ground, and among the pleasant memories
of men trained in this Station not the least is the Blackdown
Garrison Theatre, which was visited weekly by
capable companies. The Sunday evening concerts in the
theatre were also a very notable and valuable feature of
the social life of the garrison.</p>

<p>Training here proceeded on the same lines, but a
further modification was now introduced for the benefit
of the large numbers of lads under military age who were
now joining. Under the Military Service Acts no men
might be sent overseas till the age of nineteen, and in
order to ensure that their training should not be unnecessarily
hurried a special syllabus of work was evolved for
them, the original scheme being so enlarged and lengthened
as to provide for such young soldiers becoming "trained"
not earlier than the age at which they might be sent to
the front. To ensure the smooth working of this amended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
scheme the young soldiers, or "A IV's" as they were
called, were grouped in special companies, and in addition
a number of "young soldier battalions" were added to
the Coastal Defence Forces.</p>

<p>In January 1918 Lieut.-Col. Montgomerie Webb
vacated command of the Battalion on attachment to the
Royal Air Force, and the Battalion was taken over by
Lieut.-Col. Hanbury Sparrow, D.S.O., M.C., Royal Berkshire
Regiment, who had come to England under the six
months exchange system. Under Lieut.-Col. Sparrow
the Battalion continued to make great strides, and his
striking personality was the means of winning every
ounce of willing and devoted service from all who had the
honour to be under his command. The work of the
Reserve Battalion during the early part of 1918 is so much
bound up with the movements of the overseas battalions
under the stress of the German offensive that we may
conveniently break off here and take up the story of the
Second Battle of the Somme.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

THE 2/4TH BATTALION IN THE SECOND BATTLE OF
THE SOMME, 1918</h2>


<h3>I. <em>Preparations for the German Offensive</em></h3>

<p>The southward move of Gough's Fifth Army was for the
purpose of extending the British lines into an area hitherto
occupied by the French. Between the 10th January and
the 3rd February 1918 a considerable sector, extending
from the River Omignon north of St Quentin to Barisis,
in the Forêt de St Gobain south of La Fère, was taken
over from the French. The responsibility for the whole
of this line, some thirty miles long, in addition to about
twelve miles from Gouzeaucourt to the Omignon, hitherto
held by Byng's Third Army, fell upon Gough.</p>

<p>The 58th Division was at first in reserve and was
billeted in the Amiens area, the 2/4th Londons being
quartered on the evening of the 22nd January at Thézy-Glimont,
a pleasant village near the confluence of the
Avre with the Noye, about eight miles south-east of
Amiens, where French pre-war civilisation was still almost
untouched. It is needless to remark how delightful to
all ranks were these peaceful surroundings after the
ghastly shell-torn swamps of Poelcapelle. About a fortnight
passed at Thézy-Glimont in the usual routine of
training, during which one or two small drafts joined the
Battalion. Lieut. B. Rivers Smith left the Battalion on
the 1st February for six months' duty in England.</p>

<p>The most important feature of the rest period was
the reorganisation of Divisions on a ten-battalion basis,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
of which a note has been given in the preceding chapter.
In the 58th Division, as in the 56th, the 4th London
Battalion was selected for continued existence, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>the end of January the 2/4th Battalion was strengthened
by the transference from the disbanded 2/1st Londons of
10 officers and 221 other ranks. The officers who joined
from the 2/1st Londons were Capt. W. D. Ramsey;
Lieuts. W. C. Morton, G. J. L. Menges, W. B. Evans;
2/Lieuts. R. H. J. Mendl, A. Woodington, C. J. C. Wildman,
W. H. Parslow, S. H. E. Crane and H. W. Durlacher.
After the reorganisation the infantry of the Division
comprised the following units:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Three Brigades of three battalions each, and one pioneer battalion.</p></div>

<p>Before the Division left the Amiens area the imminence
of a German offensive was a matter of common knowledge
to all ranks, and so impressed with the seriousness of the
situation was the High Command, that on the 5th February
a most inspiring message from General Gough was conveyed
in a lecture by the Brigadier, to all officers, warrant
officers and sergeants of the Brigade.</p>

<p>The state of affairs was indeed critical and a grave
crisis in the War was approaching. Some slight account
of the general conditions which had brought this about
has already been attempted, and there is no occasion now
to recapitulate the main factors of the situation in which
the Allies found themselves. We must, however, point
to one or two conditions especially attaching to the British
front which had a pre-eminent influence on what followed.</p>

<p>The gradual and ever-increasing numerical preponderance
of the Germans on the British front has been
referred to; translated into numbers the position may be
better appreciated. During the period from the 1st
November 1917 to the 21st March 1918, the number of
German divisions on the Western front rose steadily from
146 to 192, an increase of 46, against which the total<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
number of British divisions in France was but 58, and
these sadly depleted in numbers. The question of the
falling off in the numbers of reinforcements sent to France
at this period has become the subject of an embittered
controversy to which we do not propose to offer any
contribution. We are, however, concerned in pointing
to the result, whatever the cause, of this growing numerical
disparity, which was to confront G.H.Q. with a most
anxious problem. The British front was now some 125
miles long, and a glance at any war map will show that
the general trend of the front was in a north-westerly
direction, <em>i.e.</em> near its northern extremity the line ran
comparatively close to the sea. In other words, the
space available for manœuvre in the event of a considerable
break-through by enemy forces was dangerously
small in the vital neighbourhood of the Channel Ports;
and a successful German offensive in this region might
have the effect of rolling up our forces against the sea.
In the south the space between the lines and the sea was
greater, but a large enemy success in the southern area
also had serious possibilities as it might entail the complete
isolation of the British Armies from the French.</p>

<p>These were very briefly the two alternative possibilities
which G.H.Q. had to face, and the problem awaiting
solution was how to provide with the inadequate force at
its disposal for the efficient defence of its lines no matter
where the blow might fall. The matter was further complicated.
The French were equally nervous of a sudden
blow against their weak spots in Champagne and at
Rheims, which might lay open the German road to Paris,
and this fear rendered it impossible for them to place
at the disposal of British G.H.Q. sufficient forces to
make up the very grave inequality of strength which
existed on the British front. The grouping of forces was,
moreover, rendered more difficult by the fact that, so
great were the available German reserves, it might well
prove that the first enemy blow, although serious and
energetic, might in reality not be the main effort. This
doubt would inevitably, whatever the Allies' dispositions
might be, have the effect of sterilising the British and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
French reserves for some days until it was quite certain
that the first blow was not a feint, to be succeeded later by
a still greater effort elsewhere.</p>

<p>Such was the problem, and surely never has a military
commander been faced by a more difficult situation; for
on the wisdom of G.H.Q.'s dispositions would probably
rest the fortunes of the whole British Empire.</p>

<p>Before stating the solution adopted by G.H.Q. in
especial relation to the doings of the 2/4th Battalion, we
may perhaps be pardoned for glancing at one or two
aspects of Ludendorff's problem which, as is now known
from his own book, was by no means free from difficulty.</p>

<p>The vital necessity of a stern British defence of the
Channel Ports was appreciated by Ludendorff as fully as
by the British G.H.Q., and he was therefore alive to the
possibility&mdash;knowing the British inferiority in numbers&mdash;that
the overwhelming importance of the north might
lead to a concentration of British divisions in the north at
the expense of the southern area. But could he be certain
that this course would be adopted? He might, after
staking his all in the south, find that British G.H.Q. had
outwitted him and anticipated his intention to attack
at St Quentin. It was clearly essential that, to achieve
the sweeping victory which alone could save Germany,
Ludendorff must endeavour to encompass the temporary
sterilisation of the Allied reserves which has been alluded
to. To ensure this his plans must be shrouded in secrecy
till the last moment; and the organisation of so vast an
attack as was ultimately launched without disclosing its
location to a vigilant enemy must have caused Ludendorff
acute anxiety. That it was in fact accomplished can only
beget admiration on our side for a most skilful opponent.
And failure to Ludendorff, moreover, was fraught with
consequences quite as awful from his point of view as his
success would be to the British. Austria had gained a
temporary respite in its victory over the Italians, but its
army was becoming disintegrated and lacking in supplies;
and no one realised more keenly than Ludendorff that
the Dual Monarchy itself could not outlive a collapse of
its army. In Germany the revolutionary ideas from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
Russia were beginning to have a weakening effect on the
loyalty and steadfastness of an increasing section of the
population; hunger was becoming intensified, for the
comparative failure of the U-boat campaign resulted in
an ever-tightening Allied blockade. And ever in front of
Ludendorff loomed the spectre of gigantic American forces
on their way to France, which the U-boats were powerless
to stop. How many Americans had landed? How soon
could they be thrown into the battle line to turn the scale
against the Central Powers? These were questions to
which Ludendorff must earnestly have sought an answer,
and which must have brought home to him the realisation
that this gigantic bid for victory he was preparing would
for good or evil be the last effort which Germany
could make.</p>

<p>The decision of G.H.Q. on these questions was that
the Channel Ports must be adequately defended at all
costs, and that if any sector of the line must be left weakly
defended, that sector must be in the southern area, which
the Fifth Army had now taken over. The depth of the
space available for retirement in rear of the lines in this
area no doubt had its influence in this decision; and in
addition, the fact that, in the event of a considerable withdrawal
of our forces under the pressure of the German
attack, a natural line of defence in rear of the forward
positions seemed to be offered in the line of the Somme,
which at Péronne makes a wide sweep southwards, thus
forming a natural barrier more or less parallel with the
British front in the St Quentin district. Possibly a further
factor was the apparent natural strength of the extreme
south of the front between Moy and La Fère, where the
Oise Canal and marshes formed a wide and difficult
obstacle between the Germans and our own troops. In
the southern area, moreover, it would in case of need be
more easy to make use quickly of such reserves as the
French might be able to place at G.H.Q.'s disposal.</p>


<h3>II. <em>The Retreat from La Fère</em></h3>

<p>The Fifth Army was allotted a front of 42 miles, which
was held by 17 divisions in line and 3 infantry and 3<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
cavalry divisions in reserve. The sector was held by
four Corps, from left to right the VII (Congreve), the
XIX (Watts), the XVIII (Maxse), and the III (Butler).</p>

<p>The III Corps, with which alone we are concerned,
comprised at the date of battle the 14th, 18th and 58th
Divisions on a front of 30,000 yards, a gigantic sector for
27 battalions, not one of which was at war strength. In
reserve were the 2nd and 3rd Cavalry Divisions. The
sector allotted to the 58th Division, in which it relieved the
30th between the 7th and 9th February 1918, was the
extreme right of the British Armies and extended from
north of Travécy, where it touched the 18th Division on
the left, to south of Barisis, where it linked up with the
French on its right. This enormous front of nearly 9½ miles
was held by two brigades, the two subsectors finding their
natural division in the Oise marshes and the Canal de St
Quentin, which at La Fère take a sudden turn westward,
thus running at right angles into the British positions. North
of the Canal the country is comparatively open and gently
undulating, while south of it the lines plunge through the
hilly and densely wooded district of the Forêt de St Gobain.</p>

<p>The marsh area at La Fère is about a mile and a half
wide, so that the frontage which needed active defence
by each Brigade was roughly four miles. On so vast a
frontage a defence by continuous trench lines was clearly
out of the question, and the British defence was designed
to be in great depth. It was divided into three zones of
defence. The Forward Zone, about 1000 yards in depth,
relied for its defence on small company redoubts with the
space between taken up by hidden machine-guns. This
zone was intended to act as a "shock-absorber" in which
the first intensity of the enemy's onslaught might be met
and checked. The main defence was to be offered in the
Battle Zone, about 1500 yards in rear of the Forward Zone.
The Battle Zone occupied a depth of about 2000 yards
and was to consist of isolated and wired forts, again
strengthened by inter-supporting machine-guns. It was
hoped that a final check might be administered to the
enemy's attempts in this zone, but in rear of it a further
defensive system, in this case a continuous line, was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
be created as a Rear Zone. Beyond this again the Somme
line was to be put into a state of defence.</p>

<p>At the date of taking over this area from the French
the defensive organisation on the lines above indicated
was practically non-existent. Very little depth was provided
for in the defence and in rear of the Forward Zone
practically all was yet to be done. The Battle Zone
redoubts were inadequate and insufficiently wired, while
the Rear Zone line was merely spit-locked.</p>

<p>For weeks, therefore, the whole energies of every
available formation, infantry holding the line, engineers,
pioneers and labour corps units from all parts of the
world, were concentrated on the enormous task of converting
the G.H.Q. scheme into a reality. Valuable time
which could have been well spent in training the infantry
in defensive measures and counter-attack, and in assimilating
the new personnel which had been brought into
battalions by the reorganisation of January, was inevitably
devoted to entrenching and wiring work, wearying
in itself and trying as only work done against time can
become. All ranks, however, were sufficiently impressed
by the need, and all were working with the zeal born of
a grim determination to prove themselves equal to the
demands which would be made upon them.</p>

<p>The 173rd Brigade moved forward to take over the left
or north brigade sector on the 7th February. The 2/4th
Battalion railed from Villers-Bretonneux to Appilly,
whence it marched to billets at Quierzy on the south bank
of the Oise. Here it was joined the following day by the
transport which had moved by road. On the evening of
the 8th the Battalion was attached temporarily to the
174th Brigade south of the Canal, and on the 9th moved
to the Forward Zone, where it relieved the 7th Londons.
As was to be expected from the conditions under which
the line was held, the Battalion was now rather scattered,
Headquarters and C and D Companies being stationed at
Amigny-Rouy, while A and B Companies were at Sinceny
and the stores and transport at Autreville. Enemy
activity in this area was almost non-existent and the
whole energies of the Battalion were devoted to entrench<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>ing
work, which was carried out under Royal Engineer
supervision. Large working parties, totalling on some
occasions 12 officers and 400 other ranks, were called
for daily for a variety of tasks to which the only relief
was a periodical exchange of companies for bathing at
Sinceny. On the 24th February the Battalion completed
the Divisional relief and moved to the extremity of the
British lines, where it relieved the 8th East Surreys,
Headquarters, C and D Companies occupying Bernagousse
Quarries, while A and B Companies were billeted in
Pierremande. In this area the Battalion spent a few quiet
days, occupied in strengthening the battle positions under
the Royal Engineers. On the 27th it was relieved by the
7th Londons, and returned to the 173rd Brigade, going into
Divisional reserve in rear of the northern brigade subsector.
In this area the Battalion was again much split up, Headquarters,
A and B Companies being at Viry Noureuil, and
C and D Companies at Tergnier. This day the Battalion
was joined by three more officers of the 2/1st Londons,
2/Lieuts. L. F. Wardle, C. B. Francis and C. W. Cumner.</p>

<p>The situation on the 173rd Brigade front during
February had been remarkably quiet. The policy adopted
had been purely defensive, and our artillery had shown
but little activity. The distance separating the British
lines from the enemy's and the nature of the terrain had
rendered observation a matter of some difficulty; but
the enemy's energies appeared to be devoted to strengthening
his own defences of La Fère rather than to the preparation
of an offensive operation. The general impression
gained from the Brigade Intelligence Summary for this
month is indeed that the idea of any attack being launched
in the La Fère area was rather ridiculous, and that everyone
was quite prepared to settle down at Fargniers for
life. General Gough, however, as is well known, did not
share this comfortable optimism, for almost a month
earlier at a conference of his Corps Commanders at
Catelet he had made what later proved to be an accurate
forecast of the location of the German attack.</p>

<p>The Battalion's work during the three weeks immediately
preceding the battle calls for little comment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
After two days in Divisional reserve it moved forward
to the Battle Zone, in which it relieved the 3rd Londons
on the 2nd March, and this position it continued to hold
until the offensive was launched, providing daily working
parties for the improvement of the defences. The early
days of March saw a slight increase of artillery and trench
mortar activity on both sides, but the area was still comparatively
quiet with but little outward indication of the
storm which was shortly to burst over it.</p>

<p>On the 7th March 2/Lieut. D. F. Crawford joined the
Battalion.</p>

<p>The skill with which the Germans continued to conceal
their intentions was indeed marvellous. For some time
past the withdrawal of divisions from the line had taken
place, but so widely disseminated had this process been
that it had attracted comparatively little notice. The
attack divisions had been assembled well in rear of the
lines, beyond the reach of our prying aeroplanes, and had
there been put through a very thorough course of training,
which extended to the smallest detail of what was expected
of each division. Finally, about the middle of March this
gigantic force had begun to move towards the line, marching
by night and closely concealed by day, and by the
evening of the 20th the enormous concentration was complete.
Von Hutier, commanding the Eighteenth German
Army, had now between the Omignon and Vendeuil 11
divisions in line, 8 in close support and 2 in reserve; Von
Gayl opposite La Fère had 4 divisions and Von Boehn
at St Gobain another 2; making a total of 27 divisions.
Opposed to this colossal strength were Butler's 5 and
Maxse's 4 weak divisions. Such were the odds on the
21st March 1918.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to the battle itself there is one
further point to which we desire to refer, and that is the
thick fog which lay over the marshes of the Oise early on
the morning of the 21st and the succeeding days. The
effect of this fog on what transpired had been variously
estimated. The general consensus of opinion of officers
and men who took part in the battle is that it was a
great disadvantage to the defence. In many ways this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
was undoubtedly the case. The complete blotting out
of all landmarks beyond a few yards' radius rendered any
sort of co-operation with adjoining units impossible; the
inter-supporting machine-guns between the redoubts were
comparatively useless for they could not see when and where
to fire. The artillery was also handicapped for it knew not
where to lay its barrages to trap the advancing enemy.
Many times in the course of the battle, redoubts which
thought themselves not yet attacked suddenly realised
that in the fog they had been surrounded and cut off.
The general result was that the defence degenerated into
a series of isolated battles in which companies and platoons
made individual stands, unsupported by their comrades
and in ignorance of what was occurring on their flanks.</p>

<p>But there is another side to the picture, and the
German opinion is equally strong, that but for the fog
their success would have been more far-reaching than it
actually proved to be. The inevitable loss of direction
and touch between attacking columns, the feeling of uncertainty
born of drifting forwards without seeing one's
surroundings, the strange tricks which fog always plays
in the matters of distance and sound&mdash;all these could not
but affect detrimentally the speed and cohesion of the
attack&mdash;and speed was of all things the essential for complete
German success. Swiftly though the attack came,
from the very first day the advances were made far
behind schedule, and to this extent the German attack
failed. How far it failed through the fog we will not
venture to estimate; but that the fog was a contributory
factor there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 20th March the order "Prepare
for attack" was received from III Corps, and by 3.30 p.m.
all companies of the Battalion were ready to man their
battle positions.</p>

<p>The scheme of defence has already been alluded to in
general terms, and it has been indicated that both the
Forward and Battle Zones were divided into a series of
defended localities each held by a company. These
localities comprised a main keep, supported by two or
more subsidiary redoubts, while the space intervening
between adjoining localities was covered by the guns of
the Brigade Machine-Gun Company.</p>

<p>The two remaining platoons of B Company were detached as
follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>1 platoon (2/Lieut. D. F. Crawford) at the junction of the
St Quentin and Crozat Canals.</p>

<p>1 platoon (Lieut. W. F. Brown) at Condren, where there
was also a squadron of the Oxfordshire Hussars.</p>

<p>Quessy Locality: 1 company 1/4th Suffolks (Pioneers).</p></div>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Brigade Headquarters were at Quessy Château near Crozat
Canal, and the 3rd Londons were in Divisional reserve
at Viry Noureuil.</p></div>

<p>It will be seen that the bulk of the defensive force
was concentrated&mdash;if such a word may be applied to so
attenuated a defence&mdash;on the right flank, where the line
of the Oise marshes, by now practically no obstacle owing
to the unusually dry spring, laid open the road to Chauny
and Noyon. It was quite evident that should the Germans
succeed in breaking through on the St Firmin-Vendeuil
front they would almost certainly endeavour to expand
the breach behind the British lines and make a south-westerly
dash towards Noyon and Compiègne in order
to complete the isolation of the British armies from the
French. The Oise flank therefore was vitally important.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<p>At 4.20 a.m. on the 21st March the enemy barrage
opened with terrific intensity. The messages to man
battle positions were already written in Brigade Headquarters,
but delay was caused in conveying them to the
various units concerned, for during the first few minutes
of the bombardment Brigade Signal Headquarters were
knocked out by a direct hit, so that this and subsequent
messages had to be sent by runner. Lieut.-Col. Dann, in
fact, did not receive any orders to move until long after
he had, on his own initiative, despatched his companies
to their posts.</p>

<p>It is rather difficult to understand why the companies
were kept in billets such as cellars under the ruins of
Fargniers and Quessy until the last moment, especially
as warning of the attack had been received the previous
afternoon. Most platoons had several hundred yards, and
some as much as a mile and a half, to traverse to their
trenches; and under the intense and accurate barrage
many casualties were sustained during this forward move.
By about 7.30 a.m., however, the companies were all
reported in position.</p>

<p>The actual time of the attack is not known, but it
probably occurred between 6.30 and 7 a.m., for at 7.10 a.m.
a message was received from Lieut.-Col. Richardson
(2/2nd Londons) that the enemy was in Jappy Keep, and
about the same time the bombardment of the Battle Zone
positions became still more intense. It must be borne in
mind that fog hung over the whole area like a thick curtain,
completely cutting off the Forward Zone from the observation,
which it had been reasonably anticipated would be
obtained over it. The Battle Zone troops and Brigade
Headquarters were thus in the dark as to what was going
on in the forward positions.</p>

<p>By 9 a.m. the enemy was reported in possession of Main
Keep Locality, which meant a serious incursion into the
defences on the vital flank. Steps were at once taken to
employ the 3rd Londons (in reserve), one company being
directed on Fargniers, while artillery and machine-gun
barrages were laid on the Canal crossings at St Firmin
and Beautor and on the area west of the captured positions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<p>Lieut.-Col. Dann now ordered forward patrols from each
of the companies to endeavour to keep in touch with the
situation, but it seems that if these orders ever reached
the companies&mdash;they certainly were not received by the
left company&mdash;the patrols themselves were destroyed by
the enemy shell fire, for no information of value was
obtained.</p>

<p>All this time no word had been received from the
Travécy Locality though attempts were made to communicate
from the 2/4th Londons and from the 18th
Division on the left, and it is probable that the fog enabled
the enemy to surround the garrison before its commander
was able to communicate with his Headquarters.</p>

<p>During the morning Lieut.-Col. Richardson asked for
counter-attack troops to be sent forward to him in the
hope that the enemy in the St Firmin area might be
ejected, but this request was refused by Division on the
ground that the Battle Zone garrisons must be maintained
intact. In consequence, therefore, of the extreme pressure
on his front, Lieut.-Col. Richardson was compelled to
order a withdrawal of the few remaining details of his
shattered battalion on to the Fargniers area occupied by
the 2/4th Londons, and by midday the fall of the Forward
Zone was complete.</p>

<p>Shortly after midday the fog lifted slightly, and the
2/4th Londons in the Battle Zone became engaged with
the enemy, who began to exert pressure on the extreme
right flank. At about 2 p.m. the platoon of A Company
holding Distillery Post next the Oise Canal was driven in
and Lieut.-Col. Dann ordered the company of the 3rd
Londons in Fargniers to launch a counter-attack. This
effort was only partly successful, and Distillery Post
remained in German hands.</p>

<p>About the same time the enemy advanced in large
numbers all along the line, especially against the Farm
Rouge and Triangle Localities. The former of these had
always been regarded as a weak spot in the defences,
and two reserve machine-guns were at once turned on to
the enemy advancing against it. By 3.45 p.m., after
a stubborn resistance against overwhelming numbers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
Clarke's weak company was ejected from the Farm Rouge
itself, and its grip on the remainder of the Locality much
weakened. The assaulting columns continued to press
on in the direction of the Quessy Locality, thus isolating
the Fargniers position in the corner between the two
Canals and completely cutting off Lester, who was still
hanging on to his position in the Triangle against impossible
odds.</p>

<p>A prompt endeavour to counter this very serious turn
of events was taken by Brigade, who sent forward two
platoons of the Suffolks to reinforce Clarke and fill the
gap between him and Askham. The 3rd Londons also
were drawn on again, and a second company was sent
forward through Quessy to strengthen the Farm Rouge
Locality. Of this company, however, only two platoons
ever reached their objective, the others being destroyed
by the enemy's fire at the crossing of the Crozat Canal.</p>

<p>At about 6.50 p.m. the Battle Zone, in spite of repeated
and heavy enemy attacks, was still intact with the
exceptions of the penetrations next the Canal on the
extreme right and in the Farm Rouge Locality, and it
was decided to lay down a provisional S.O.S. line on the
forward edge of the Battle Zone. The enemy, however,
was continuing his attacks with great persistence, and the
gradual infiltration of his storm troops between our
scattered positions was constantly altering the situation.
By 7.15 p.m. he had already overrun the new S.O.S. line
in the vicinity of the Distillery, and was beginning to
close in on Fargniers from the south.</p>

<p>In the 18th Division area on the left the struggle was
also raging in the Battle Zone, though one or two posts
in the Forward Zone were continuing their glorious yet
hopeless struggle. Beyond the 18th Division the 14th
had received a severe blow and the Germans had penetrated
some miles into the British positions. It appeared by no
means improbable that if the enemy's progress in this
region were unchecked the left flank of the III Corps
would be entirely rolled up. A general withdrawal was
therefore inevitable to prevent the line being broken.
To conform with these movements it was decided by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
Division to effect a withdrawal to the line of the Crozat
Canal from its junction with the St Quentin Canal as far
north as a line running due west between the Farm Rouge
and Triangle Localities, which latter was to be held.</p>

<p>Instructions to this end were immediately issued, and
Lieut.-Col. Dann was ordered to conduct the withdrawal
of the whole of the mixed details now in the Fargniers
corner, and all troops in the Battle Zone were placed
under his orders. This withdrawal was really a stubborn
rearguard action, for the enemy was unrelenting in his
efforts to drive in the Farm Rouge gap and reach the
Canal. But a stern resistance was offered in which gallant
service was rendered by the Suffolks at Quessy, and by
midnight Lieut.-Col. Dann was enabled to report his
heterogeneous command in position on the west bank of
the Canal, with all iron rations, S.A.A., stores and Orderly
Room records intact.</p>

<p>The defence of the Triangle Locality must now be
referred to as it comprises, owing to the wedge driven into
the Farm Rouge Locality early in the day, an isolated
battle, and is a magnificent example of stern courage
against overwhelming numbers. The casualties suffered
from gas shell in this area had been numerous, but apart
from the accurate shooting of the Bosche gunners, C
Company had been, like the rest of the Battalion, not
closely engaged until the Forward Zone was overrun.
The lifting of the fog about midday disclosed a large
force of the enemy, which is estimated at about a
battalion, advancing against Lester's thinly held positions.
From this time onwards no orders or messages of any
kind reached Lester from Battalion Headquarters or the
adjoining companies, and he was left to fight his own
battle. The advancing enemy were hotly engaged by
rifle and Lewis gun fire, and large numbers were killed.
Already D Company were losing their grip on the Farm
Rouge, but Lester decided that the only course open to
him was to await reinforcements. These never came, and
probably, owing to the utter severance of communications,
it was never realised how urgent his need was. The only
support to this gallant company was one 18-pr. gun firing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
over open sights from near Quessy. All the afternoon
the unequal fight was maintained, though the defenders
were much harassed by low-flying German 'planes. With
the approach of dusk the mist came down again, surrounding
the company with an impenetrable curtain. Again and
again Lester sent out runners and patrols to seek connection
with the adjoining troops but these never returned.
"I still hoped against hope," he writes, "that we should
be reinforced, as the Colonel had kept rubbing it in at
conferences before the battle that we had to stand fast
at all costs." At last it became clear that the flanks were
in the air and that the rear of the Company was being
encircled, and it was decided to fight back to the Crozat
Canal. On the left the remains of two platoons under
Blair managed to get back, but of the others but two men
got away, and Lester, Wardle and the remainder of the
company, nearly all wounded, were captured.</p>

<p>This splendid fight, maintained till nearly 10 p.m.
against hopeless odds, was without doubt of enormous value
in holding up the enemy and inflicting severe loss on his
picked troops. It also formed a strong buttress to the flank
of the 18th Division, without which they would have found
the right of their Battle Zone turned; and it gave time
for the withdrawal of the 2/4th Londons to the Canal line.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Col. Dann's mixed force on the Canal was of
necessity in need of organisation, and the 8th Londons,
who had been in reserve at Pierremande, were on their
way to relieve the troops who had borne the day's fighting.
By 6 a.m. the relief was complete and the 8th Londons
were established on the Canal line, while Lieut.-Col. Dann's
force, consisting of the remains of the 2/2nd, 3rd and 2/4th
Battalions, the Suffolks, and elements of the 503rd Field
Company R.E. and of the 182nd Tunnelling Company,
who had also been thrown into the fight, were assembled
on a line west of Vouel, with Headquarters on the Butte
de Vouel. This position was an unfinished work, in parts
not more than a foot deep, and extended from the Butte
almost due south to the Chauny-Tergnier Road. Brigade
Headquarters had withdrawn overnight to Le Bas de Viry.</p>

<p>The Condren position, which had not been attacked on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
the 21st, remained intact but was reinforced by a company
of the Suffolks.</p>

<p>The results of the first day's fighting were tolerably
serious. The Forward and Battle Zones had been lost,
and thus the greater part of the defences which had been
brought to a stage in any way approaching completion
were in the enemy's hands. The whole of the available
reserves were already inextricably in the fight, and should
the attack extend to the Southern Brigade area from
Amigny-Rouy to Barisis there would be no means of
assisting the defence in that vicinity. Serious losses of
personnel had been sustained, and the swiftness and
weight of the blow had had their effect, though the morale
of the troops were still high. On the other hand the
enemy had by no means gained the success which he had
anticipated. On the Brigade front of some 5000 yards,
held by two weak battalions reinforced by parts of one
other battalion, he had employed nearly four divisions,
and in spite of these ridiculous odds had only advanced
an average of about 5000 yards to find that the defence
had successfully withdrawn behind an obstacle of much
natural strength. The defence was shaken, but it was
not in the least broken, and a break through was the only
means of ultimate success to the Germans.</p>

<p>On arrival in the Vouel line in the early hours of the
22nd March, the Battalion, which occupied the north end
of the position near the Butte, was reorganised in three
companies, with A Company under 2/Lieut. F. G. Williams
on the right, B under Capt. Askham in the centre and D
under Capt. Clarke on the left. As on the 21st, a dense
mist appeared with the early hours, and until it rose,
shortly after midday, no infantry movement took place.
Under cover of the mist the Battalion was able to do a
good deal of work on the Vouel line, and in this they were
not much interfered with, as most of the German shells
were falling on the road in front.</p>

<p>About 1.15 p.m. the enemy attack opened with great
vigour and immense weight on the Canal line and Tergnier.
The crossing of the Canal was rendered easier to the enemy
by reason of the unfortunate fact that one or two bridges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
had not been entirely demolished after our withdrawal.
All had long before been prepared for demolition, but for
some reason the charges did not explode in every case. A
certain bewilderment was caused to the defenders at first
as the Germans appear to have gained their first footing
west of the Canal disguised in British uniforms stolen from
the fallen men of the 2/2nd Londons. But as soon as
the 8th Londons appreciated what was happening they put
up a very stubborn resistance. After getting across the
Canal the Bosche seems to have tried to extend north and
south along the western bank, and in this he was successful
in the northern area. In the south, however, the magnificent
fight made by the two companies in Tergnier checked
his progress, and time after time his attacks were stopped.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the German 'planes were seeking
for the next position held by us, and in spite of the hasty
efforts of the Battalion to camouflage its trench, the Vouel
line was soon discovered, and ranging on it by the German
batteries rapidly ensued. No infantry attack was delivered
on the Vouel line, probably on account of the enemy's
lack of success at Tergnier.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the enemy's pressure on the 8th
Londons grew almost intolerable, and little by little he was
working his way into Tergnier. It was therefore decided
to vacate the position, and after dusk the 8th Londons fell
back on to the Vouel line, which they extended to the right
from the Viry-Tergnier Road as far as the railway. The
two companies in Tergnier were ably extricated by their
commander and managed to get clear across the Oise, joining
the garrison at Condren, which had not been attacked.</p>

<p>The Vouel line was now the most advanced position,
and at 6.30 p.m. the Headquarters of the 3rd, 2/4th and
8th Londons were withdrawn from it to Noureuil. The
night passed without any further attempt on the enemy's
part to advance, and on our side a good deal of patrolling
activity took place. This led to several encounters with
small parties of enemy, and resulted in the collection of
a quite useful bag of German prisoners as well as a machine-gun
and team. Under cover of darkness also touch was
regained with the Condren garrison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p>Information was received on the evening of the 22nd
that French troops were rapidly advancing to our assistance,
and that they would be ready to counter-attack the next
morning with the object of retaking the Crozat Canal line.</p>

<p>On the 23rd March mist appeared yet once more,
considerably hampering our defence and giving the enemy
an opportunity of massing for attack. Shortly after
8 a.m. the French attack was launched by two battalions
of the 125th French Infantry which passed forward through
the Vouel line. The result of the attack is not definitely
known as it was impossible to see beyond a radius of about
15 yards. It is certain, however, that it failed to reach
Tergnier, and by 11 a.m. the French advance was broken
and the troops beginning to drift back into our lines. It
should be pointed out in fairness to our Allies that they
had been rushed up into the line, incomplete in equipment
and transport, and that they were called on to operate
without previous reconnaissance over ground which was
shrouded in mist and unknown to them. On the extreme
left the withdrawal was conducted in some disorder, and
it was reported that the 18th Division on our left was also
being forced back through Frières Wood. The Vouel line,
unfinished and shallow as it was, was already occupied
to its fullest capacity, and the French falling back on
it caused considerable congestion in the well-dug parts.
About the same time the German artillery, which had been
plastering the Vouel line fairly steadily all the morning,
lifted, and was at once succeeded by an accurate and
intense machine-gun barrage. This further tended to
create difficulty in the position, for in view of the congestion
of the trench it became very hard to get orders
along, while work on the gaps between the well dug
portions was almost impossible.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the mist cleared and the awkwardness
of the situation became more apparent. The 18th
Division were being pressed back towards Villequier-Aumont,
and the left flank was entirely in the air, while
the constant pushing of small highly trained bodies of
the enemy was enabling them to progress along the Oise
marshes on the right. Vouel itself was strongly occupied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
and troops were massing for attack. By 12 noon the
position was no longer tenable. The enemy was advancing
frontally and from both flanks, and Lieut.-Col. Dann
ordered a withdrawal on to the Green line. This was a
partly dug position which formed a portion of the Rear
Zone and was held by troops of the 6th Dismounted
Cavalry Brigade and the 18th Entrenching Battalion, on a
line east of Noureuil and Viry-Noureuil from the St Quentin
Canal to the Vouel-Villequier Road. The withdrawal to
the Green line from the Vouel position averaged about 1500
yards, and so hard were the enemy pressing that some
platoons had to fight their way back. An attempt was made
by the French machine-gunners in the Vouel line to cover
the Battalion's withdrawal, but this was not effective and,
together with several of our own men, they were captured.</p>

<p>The situation was now critical. The falling back of
the 18th Division on the left revealed a gap between
the Vouel-Villequier Road and Frières Wood of which
the enemy was not slow to take advantage, and there
appeared every likelihood that the 173rd Brigade would
be cut off from the 18th Division and rolled up against the
St Quentin Canal. To meet this threat the left flank
of the Green line position, consisting of troops of the
Dismounted Brigade and details of the 8th Londons, was
thrown back and extended towards Villequier-Aumont
in an attempt to gain touch once more with the 18th
Division. This line was thin, and under the continued
German pressure it suffered severely. During the afternoon
the enemy thrust south again and entered Noureuil,
thus driving a wedge behind the flank of the Green line
troops. A glance at the map will show that a further
withdrawal was inevitable if the whole Brigade was not
to be rounded up. This began about 6 p.m. and the
troops, including all that was left of the fighting ranks
of the 2/4th Londons, about 120 all told under Capt.
Askham, fell back to a position west of Viry-Noureuil,
which village was yielded to the enemy.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, while the fate of the bulk of the
Brigade was still in the balance, and it was obviously
imperative to check the enemy's advance into Chauny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
by all available means, the Brigadier ordered Major Grover
of the 2/4th Londons, who was at Chauny with battle
surplus, to organise all available details for the defence
of the town. With remarkable skill and despatch Major
Grover collected a heterogeneous force of clerks, cooks,
officers' servants, transport drivers&mdash;anyone who could
hold a rifle&mdash;and by dusk reported himself in position on
the eastern outskirts of Chauny with a force of 10 officers
and 270 other ranks at his command. Of these, 2 officers
and 54 other ranks were of the 2/4th Londons. This very
brilliant piece of work no doubt did much to save the
situation, and "Grover's Force" beyond question deserves
to rank high among the various similar "scarecrow
armies" which these critical days produced.</p>

<p>During the afternoon Lieut.-Col. Dann was attached
for duty to Brigade Headquarters, and the remains of the
2/4th and 8th Londons came under command of Lieut.-Col.
Derviche-Jones of the latter Battalion.</p>

<p>The withdrawal from the Green line to the River
Helot position was considerably impeded by the French
troops who were streaming in a westerly direction, and
Brigade therefore endeavoured to ascertain what the
intentions of the French Commander were. These were
found to be to hold a line from Viry-Noureuil to Villequier-Aumont,
and accordingly it was decided that the whole
of the 173rd Brigade Group should be withdrawn and
reorganised in positions to support the French. This reorganisation
was successfully carried out. In view of the
rapid and confusing moves which had followed each other
in such quick succession, it may be well to state in detail
the Brigade positions at dawn on the 24th March:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Brigade Headquarters at Abbécourt</span>
</p>

<div class="hangindent8">

<p><span class="smcap">Grover's Force</span>&mdash;Covering the eastern exits of Chauny from the
St Quentin Canal to north of the Chauny&mdash;Viry-Noureuil
Road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">18th Entrenching Battalion</span>&mdash;Astride the St Quentin Canal on
the right of Grover's Force.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">6th Dismounted Cavalry Brigade</span>&mdash;On the left of Grover's Force
east of the Chauny&mdash;Villequier-Aumont Road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Details of the 2/4th and 8th Londons</span>&mdash;On the left of Grover's
Force west of the Chauny&mdash;Villequier-Aumont
Road.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>

<p>The Condren garrison substantially maintained its
original positions and was in touch by means of patrols
with the 18th Entrenching Battalion, while on the extreme
right the 174th Brigade, which had not been attacked,
continued to hold the Amigny-Rouy&mdash;Barisis front.</p>

<p>On the left of the conglomerate force which now
formed the 173rd Brigade Group the line was continued
by the 18th and 14th Divisions, with whom French troops
were interspersed in the direction of Cugny.</p>

<p>The whole line was strained to breaking-point under
the unceasing enemy pressure. Every available man was
in the firing line, and the Battalion, which had been now
fighting and marching without intermission for three days,
was getting worn. But in spite of the enormous odds the
Battalion clung on with determination, for it knew that
the saving of the situation rested with itself, and attack
after attack had failed to give the German masses the
break-through which was essential for them.</p>

<p>For the fourth day in succession the Germans were
favoured with a thick fog which enshrouded their movements,
and under cover of which they were able to prepare
a further heavy blow. Early in the morning they
attacked and broke through the French outpost line on
the River Helot, and about 11 a.m. the lifting of the mist
revealed them attacking Grover's Force east of Chauny,
and also endeavouring to work round the south of the
position next the Canal. This was serious, for a wedge
driven in between the Chauny line and the Condren
bridgehead, which was also under great pressure from the
enemy, might possibly involve the loss of the Oise line, the
retention of which was vital for us.</p>

<p>Arrangements were at once made by Brigade for a
further withdrawal, and this was rendered the more
imperative by the rapid advance made on the left of the
Corps front during the day. In this region the enemy
were already threatening Guiscard, eight miles north-west
of Chauny, and the security of Noyon itself was seriously
in doubt.</p>

<p>For several hours Grover's details and the tiny Condren
force maintained their fight, but in the afternoon the with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>drawal
began in accordance with the orders already issued.
Under Grover's command the mixed force was skilfully
withdrawn, fighting a stubborn rearguard action, to a
prepared position about 1000 yards east of Abbécourt,
while the detached portion of the 2/4th Londons on
Grover's left, now about 60 strong, fell back to Ognes,
and marched into Besme across the Oise about midnight.
Early in the afternoon Major Grover was wounded and
Capt. Askham took over his command. By 4.30 p.m.
the Abbécourt position, being no longer tenable, was
vacated and the whole of the 173rd Group, including
2/4th and 8th Londons, 503rd Field Company, R.E. and the
6th Dismounted Cavalry Brigade, had crossed the Oise at
Manicamp. About the same time the Condren garrison
which had held manfully to its positions since the opening
of the battle got clear across the river.</p>

<p>Before this withdrawal was completed the whole of
the Oise bridges, and also the R.E. Dump at Chauny, were
demolished, and it may be remarked that during the four
days of fighting not a single gun had been lost except those
destroyed by enemy shell fire.</p>

<p>With the withdrawal across the Oise the hardest of
the Battalion's fighting in this great battle was finished,
though it remained in contact with the enemy with very
little rest. The Division now held a river front of over
nine miles on the south bank of the Oise from Quierzy to
Servais, in addition to the original four miles held by the
174th Brigade in the Forêt de St Gobain. With this
enormous front in contact with an enterprising enemy no
rest was yet to be expected. The early hours of the
25th March were devoted to sorting out the hopeless tangle
of units which the battle had caused, and at 11.30 a.m.
Lieut.-Col. Dann became responsible (in conjunction with
the 6th Dismounted Cavalry Brigade) for the defence of the
river crossings at Quierzy, with a composite force comprising
details of four battalions, reorganised in companies
as follows:</p>

<p>This company of the 2/4th Londons was the party of
60 which had reached Besme the previous evening, and
was now under 2/Lieut. Griffiths.</p>

<p>The same night (25th/26th March) this composite
force was relieved by the 246th French Regiment and
withdrew to Besme to refit, Lieut.-Col. Dann taking
charge of another composite force of troops of the 175th
Brigade. In the meantime the remainder of the 2/4th
Londons, which had formed part of Grover's Force and
were now under Askham, took up a defensive position
under orders of Lieut.-Col. Chart, 18th Entrenching
Battalion, east of Manicamp, on the south side of the
Canal and the Ailette River. At night this party was
also relieved by Lieut.-Col. Dann's force and joined the
remainder of the Battalion at Besme.</p>

<p>The 173rd Brigade was now entirely extricated from
the line, and a day of reorganisation and collection of
scattered details from the various composite forces, which
the needs of the moment had created, was of urgent
necessity. This respite was obtained on the 26th March
when the three original units were reorganised as one
battalion, known as the Fusilier Battalion as follows:</p>

<p>Lieut.-Col. Dann returned from the 175th Brigade to
command this newly constituted force. In addition to
the Fusilier Battalion, the Brigade included temporarily
the 12th Londons under Lieut.-Col. Bayliffe, C.M.G., and
the 18th Entrenching Battalion under Lieut.-Col. Chart.</p>

<p>The whole of the III Corps had now been brought south
of the Oise, and Noyon fell into the enemy's hands on the
26th. The main weight of the German offensive continued
to sweep westward in the direction of Amiens, but with
the details of this part of the fight we are not concerned.
The 58th Division, however, was not yet out of the fight,
and the enemy made repeated efforts to force a breach
in the long river line which it held, but without success.
The French troops were now numerous in this area, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
though General Butler continued to command his own
Corps, the supreme command of the area was taken by
the French.</p>

<p>In this battle the Battalion had the extraordinary
experience of being driven entirely out of the battle area.
It had lost severely and borne several days of the most
terrific ordeal that it had yet been called on to face, but
with the exception of a deep indentation in its positions at
Farm Rouge on the first day there had never been any
semblance of a break-through on its front. Frequently
hard pressed, often almost surrounded, it had been forced
back day after day, stubbornly fighting but never broken.</p>

<p>Constituted as described above the 173rd Brigade took
over the Manicamp sector from the 175th on the evening
of the 27th March, the 12th Londons occupying the right
subsector, with the Fusilier Battalion on the left adjoining
Manicamp village. The two 2/4th London Companies
were stationed on the Ailette River and in the village.
The Brigade remained in these positions strengthening the
defences until the night of 2nd/3rd April, when it was
relieved by the French, the Fusilier Battalion reaching
Blérancourt at midnight. The daylight hours of the
3rd April were occupied in resting and cleaning up, and
after dark the Battalion moved to Andignicourt, where it
was accommodated in an enormous cave probably large
enough to hold a brigade at full strength.</p>

<p>The following afternoon the route was continued and
the Battalion reached Amblèny at 8 p.m. Here the
Fusilier Battalion broke up, its component companies
being once more organised as three battalions under their
respective commanders. The 12th Londons returned to
their own brigade, being replaced in the 173rd Brigade
by the 16th Entrenching Battalion (Lieut.-Col. Nicholls).</p>

<p>The 2/4th Londons were joined on the 3rd April by
Major F. G. Tollworthy, 1st Londons, as second in
command vice Major Grover wounded.</p>

<p>On the 5th April another evening march was made to
Dommiers, and the next day after a very trying march
the Battalion reached Villers Cotterets at 8 p.m. Here
it entrained with the remainder of the Division for an area<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
further north to which the III Corps had been transferred.
The total casualties sustained by the 2/4th Battalion in
the second battle of the Somme between 21st March and
3rd April amounted to:</p>

<div class="hangindent8">

<p>Officers&mdash;Lieut. J. Cairns, missing, believed killed; 2/Lieut.
F. G. Williams, died of wounds; Major A. Grover,
M.C., Capt. C. A. Clarke, M.C., Lieut, H. J. M.

D. F. Crawford and L. F. Wardle, captured.</p>

<p>N.C.O.'s and men: 37 killed, 125 wounded and 217 missing.</p></div>

<p>The total losses of the Division for the same period
were 2204, of whom 57 officers and 1606 other ranks
were missing.</p>


<h3>III. <em>The Action at Villers-Bretonneux</em></h3>

<p>In the first portion of this chapter we have endeavoured
to give some account of the manner in which the 2/4th
Battalion, with the 58th Division and the whole of Butler's
III Corps, had been literally pushed aside by the main
force of the German onslaught and had been extricated
from the fight due southwards through French territory,
while the advancing enemy had swept on in a westerly
direction towards Amiens.</p>

<p>By the evening of the 28th March, that is to say, a
week after the opening of the battle, the Fifth and Third
Armies had been forced back from the line of the Somme
and over the old Somme battlefields, and had reached the
Amiens defence line south of the Somme, while on the
north bank the enemy had occupied Albert.</p>

<p>On the 28th March a further attack was delivered on
a wide front from north of Arras to Puisieux which resulted
in a severe defeat for the Germans; but as only the 1/4th
Battalion is concerned in the fighting on this day we
propose to defer the account of it to another chapter, and
to pursue for the moment the fortunes of the 2/4th Battalion
until the final stabilisation of the line in front of Amiens.</p>

<p>The German offensive on the Somme front was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
showing signs of weakening, though owing to the enormous
losses incurred by our divisions in personnel and material
the enemy was still able to make progress. The defences
of Amiens in particular were threatened, and Gen.
Gough had been entrusted by G.H.Q. with the task of
extending and strengthening them. The last days of
March saw fierce fighting in this area, and by the 31st of
the month the Fifth Army south of the Amiens-Péronne
Road had fallen back to the line Villers-Bretonneux-Hangard,
both villages inclusive to the British, while on
the right the French were holding a small corner of the
angle between the Luce and Avre Rivers on the line
Hangard-Moreuil Station. The German attacks finally
exhausted themselves by April 5th, after which date
there was a short period of trench warfare.</p>

<p>It was to this area, still on the extreme right of the
British Armies, that the 58th Division was now directed.
From Villers Cotterets, which it left on 6th April, the
2/4th Battalion was railed to Longueau, a suburb of
Amiens. The battle line was now quite close to the
Amiens-Paris line, a lateral railroad of vital importance
to us, and as the Battalion passed Boves the British field
guns were in action within a quarter of a mile of the train.</p>

<p>On detrainment the Battalion marched to a reserve
position in the Bois de Gentelles, where a long day was
devoted to reorganisation. The losses of the latter end
of March had not yet been made good by reinforcements,
and it was therefore decided to make use of the 16th
Entrenching Battalion for this purpose. Accordingly on
the 7th April two companies of this unit were transferred
to the 2/4th Battalion, making an increase of strength
of 4 officers (Capt. B. H. C. Hettler, M.C., and 2/Lieuts.
J. W. Bocking, E. V. Grimsdell and W. T. Millar) and
344 other ranks. With this valuable reinforcement it was
possible once again to organise four companies as follows:</p>

<p>It should be remarked in passing that the Entrenching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
Battalions had no connection with the Labour Corps.
They were trained and combatant troops whose existence
as Entrenching Battalions only dated from the Divisional
reorganisations of the preceding January, and they represented
in effect the troops which had been "left over"
after the reorganisation was completed. The bulk of the
reinforcement which thus came to the 2/4th Battalion
were enlisted in the 6th K.O.Y.L.I., and were undoubtedly
some of the finest reinforcements the Battalion ever
received: although young they were very keen, and
included some most reliable non-commissioned officers.</p>

<p>At 7.45 p.m. on the 7th April the Battalion relieved
the 12th Londons in the Reserve system between the
village of Gentelles and the Amiens-Roye Road, Nos. 3
and 4 Companies occupying the front line with Nos. 1 and
2 in support to them and Headquarters in the Bois de
Gentelles. For ten days the Battalion continued to
occupy these positions, constantly employed in working
parties on its own defences and on elaborately wiring the
lines in conjunction with the R.E.'s. This wire was
strengthened to form a considerable obstacle for the
Gentelles line, which was the final line of the Amiens
defences and was to be held at all costs. During this
tour of duty the 2/4th Battalion suffered somewhat from
German shell fire, for the British batteries were close
behind the Gentelles line.</p>

<p>It was confidently anticipated that the enemy would
endeavour once more to break the Amiens defences in
this area. The village of Villers-Bretonneux stands on a
somewhat prominent hill seven miles east of Amiens, and
its possession would have enabled the Germans to play
havoc by their artillery with the city itself and our important
road and railway communications which radiate
from it. Its value to the Germans rendered it a matter
of the highest importance to us to defend it stubbornly.
In anticipation of an attack, therefore, the battle surplus
was sent out of the trenches on the 10th and the work of
strengthening the defences pressed on with vigour.</p>

<p>Further reinforcements were received from the Base,
numbering in all 127 other ranks. These were mostly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
young lads under nineteen years of age whose despatch
overseas had been rendered necessary by the impossibility
of otherwise replacing the deficiencies in the ranks. They
were all extremely keen and had received a good groundwork
of training at home. But they reached the Battalion
at a time when it had just been shaken by one battle
and was about to become involved in another, and it
can only be deplored that circumstances prevented any
opportunity for assimilating them into the Battalion and
for giving them some preliminary experience of warfare
under quieter conditions. The whole Battalion was
indeed rather conglomerate, for of a total of some 650
rifles about 450 were strange to the Battalion and called
upon to go into action under a command unknown to
them: this important point should be borne in mind in
considering the battle which followed.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 18th April the 58th Division
took over from the 5th Australian Brigade the front line
east of Cachy, the 173rd Brigade occupying the whole
sector. This sector extended from the immediate left of
Hangard, through the Bois de Hangard to the Villers-Bretonneux-Demuin
Road, the 3rd Londons on the
right, the 2/2nd in the centre and the 2/4th on the left.
The 2/4th Battalion's subsector, in which it relieved the
19th Australian Battalion, about 1500 yards frontage, was
held with three companies (Nos. 1, 2 and 4) in the front
line and one (No. 3) in support, Headquarters occupying
a quarry east of Cachy. The 175th Brigade took over
the Blue line while the 174th was in reserve in Cagny.</p>

<p>The Battalion was now straining every nerve to complete
the defences. Much work was still to be done. The
front line had originally existed as a line of isolated posts,
and these were not yet completely connected up nor were
they adequately wired. A great deal was to be done in
providing efficient fire positions throughout the line in
order that if lateral movement should become necessary
the defence of the position might not be impaired.</p>

<p>Orders were received that the front line would be held
till the last. The support company would be employed
for counter-attack purposes in the event of the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
gaining a footing in our positions; and the success of the
defence would clearly depend on the rapidity and skill
with which this local reserve was used. The right flank
of the Brigade front was further strengthened by the 10th
Londons, who were temporarily attached in Brigade reserve.</p>

<p>On the 21st the Battalion suffered a severe loss in the
adjutant, Capt. F. W. Walker, D.S.O., who was wounded,
his duties being taken by Lieut. S. A. Seys, the assistant
adjutant. On the 23rd Capt. Hetley was attached to the
131st French Divisional Headquarters as liaison officer,
and his company was handed over temporarily to Capt.
W. C. Morton.</p>

<p>The same day information was obtained from Alsatian
deserters that the enemy attack would take place at dawn
the following morning.</p>

<p>We may restate the distribution of companies in the
trenches as follows:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>In Front&mdash;  No. 2 (Askham) on the right.</dt>
  <dd>No. 1 (Morton) in the centre.</dd>
  <dd>No. 4 (Grimsdell) on the left.</dd>
  <dt>In Support&mdash;No. 3 (Hettler).</dt>
</dl>

<p>By an extraordinary chance the enemy was yet once
more favoured by the weather, for, when his barrage
dropped on our lines at 4 a.m. on the 24th April with
bitter intensity and great accuracy, the day was dawning
on a dense mist which impeded observation beyond a
radius of about 50 yards. The bombardment was severe,
and in the area of forward battery positions included
gas shell.</p>

<p>The attack appears to have developed at widely
different hours in different parts of the line: the S.O.S.
was received from the 8th Division on the left as early as
5.40 a.m., and from Hangard at 6 a.m., but it was not
until 6.20 a.m. that reports indicated that the 173rd
Brigade front was generally engaged. On the 2/4th
Battalion front all was ready to receive the advancing
waves of German infantry, but it must be admitted that
some of the stoutest hearts were filled with something
approaching dismay when out of the fog, at a distance of
40 to 50 yards, loomed the weird forms of German tanks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
So far as can be ascertained about six tanks were directed
on the 2/4th Battalion's sector, and it was the only
Battalion of the Brigade against which they advanced.
The tanks seem to have been uncertain of their bearings
in the mist and not too skilfully handled. One at least
devoted its energies to describing small circles, firing wildly
into the ground where none of our troops were posted.</p>

<p>In spite of this unskilful manœuvring, however, there
is no doubt that the sudden appearance of these monsters
shook our defence for a moment, and the men fell back
a short distance. They remained perfectly under control,
and were rapidly rallied by their officers a short distance
in rear of the front trench, after which the German infantry,
advancing in three waves close behind the tanks, were
hotly engaged with rifle and Lewis gun fire, which inflicted
heavy loss on them. Askham was hit about twenty
minutes after the attack began, and after his departure
to the Aid Post charge of affairs in the firing line, so far
as control was possible over a wide front in the mist, was
assumed by Morton of No. 1 Company. The first news
of what was occurring in front was received at Battalion
Headquarters from Morton in a message timed 6.30 a.m.:
"Tanks have crossed front line trenches, front line has
fallen back, have rallied them at Coy. H.Q. line."</p>

<p>Steadily the tanks pressed our line back though our
retirement was carried out gradually and at ghastly loss
to the German infantry; and finally Morton was able to
collect all available men of the 2/4th Battalion in the
Cachy Switch.</p>

<p>The support company put up a good fight&mdash;Hettler
was hit early&mdash;and eventually was nearly surrounded;
but it cut its way out and managed also to gain the Cachy
Switch. The Divisional records time our retirement to
the Cachy Switch at 7.40 a.m., but there seems no doubt
that the Battalion's resistance was much more prolonged
than this would indicate. Certainly Morton was not able
to report the organisation of his new position till 10.15 a.m.
By this time only about one hundred men of the Battalion
with three subalterns, Prince, Sheppard and Ewing, were
under Morton's hand, though others rejoined later. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
2/4th Battalion's retirement had involved the risk of
leaving the left flank of the 2/2nd Londons on its right
in the air, but this Battalion conformed to our movement,
though a gap ensued between the two units. This was
promptly filled by Brigade, who sent forward a company
of the 2/10th Londons. By midday our line was more
or less stabilised on a line from the Cachy Switch immediately
in front of Cachy village along the Hangard Road.
This meant that Hangard Wood was lost, and from the
left flank the bad news was also received that Villers-Bretonneux
had fallen into the enemy's hands.</p>

<p>Beyond artillery activity no further action of importance
occurred on the Battalion's front during the afternoon,
which was busily occupied in forming a line of shell hole
defences in the new position and in feeling out to the flanks
to gain touch with adjoining units.</p>

<p>This was the only occasion on which either Battalion
of the regiment was called on to face tanks. There can
be no question as to the tremendous moral effect of these
machines, though their actual destructiveness&mdash;handled
as they were&mdash;was not great. Under the conditions of
mist which prevented any warning of their approach, and
the conglomerate composition of the Battalion, a little
initial unsteadiness on the part of the less trained elements
of the Battalion was almost to be expected in face of such
an ordeal. The rapid recovery and steady rearguard fight
back to the Cachy line, however, showed that after the first
shock the innate discipline of the Londoner asserted itself
and the number of enemy dead counted on the field was
evidence of the heavy cost to the Germans of their success.</p>

<p>2/Lieut. Ewing should be mentioned. "His behaviour
was splendid throughout. During the preliminary bombardment
he was constantly up and down his sector
encouraging his men, and when the enemy ultimately
appeared his fire orders were clear and effective." He
was awarded the M.C., as was also Capt. Morton, who displayed
throughout the day marked qualities of leadership
and coolness. Pte. Petrie, a stretcher-bearer who gained
the M.M., exhibited an utter disregard of personal danger
in pursuing his work of bringing in and tending wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<p>The heavy casualties sustained this day in "missing"
were due to the fact that in retirement the Battalion was
forced to leave many men, who might otherwise have been
saved, in the enemy's hands. But the R.A.M.C. staff
under Lieut. Dunaway worked magnificently under heavy
shell fire till the last moment, thereby retrieving many
wounded men who must otherwise have been captured.</p>

<p>We have already pointed to the great importance of
Villers-Bretonneux in the defence of Amiens, and it is
not surprising therefore that its loss was followed by an
immediate order from Army Headquarters that it must
be recaptured at all costs.</p>

<p>The counter-attack was delivered at 10 p.m. on the
24th April by the 9th Londons, the 54th Brigade and the
Australians. Villers-Bretonneux again passed into our
hands, while on the 58th Division's front the line was
advanced about half-way forward from the Cachy Switch
to the original front line.</p>

<p>During the 25th April the 2/4th Battalion was not
engaged, though it was all day long subjected to severe
artillery fire, which inflicted a good many casualties. On
the evening of the 25th the 2/4th Battalion was relieved
by troops of the French Moroccan Division, and withdrew
on relief to bivouacs in open country east of Boves.</p>

<p>The casualties of the two days' action were:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>2/Lieut. J. W. Booking, killed; Capts. S. G. Askham, M.C.,
B. H. C. Hettler, M.C., 2/Lieuts. S. F. G. Mears, P. J. Payne
and L. H. Sheppard, wounded; 2/Lieuts. S. C. Geering and
C. W. Cumner, missing; and in N.C.O.'s and men 23 killed,
108 wounded and 203 missing.</p></div>

<p>During the 26th April the Moroccan Division continued
the counter-attack, and at the end of the day the line
was substantially restored to its position prior to the
German attack.</p>

<p>This was the last serious German attempt to reach
Amiens. The line had bent perilously, but the offensive
in this area had been fought to a standstill. At this point,
therefore, we may leave the 2/4th Battalion and deal with the
defence of Arras, in which the 1/4th Battalion bore a part.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

THE 1/4TH BATTALION IN THE DEFENCE OF ARRAS, 1918</h2>


<p>On the 11th March 1918 the 1/4th Londons took over the
Oppy Trenches from the Kensingtons.</p>

<p>There was no room for doubt now that the Germans
intended sooner or later to launch a big attack in this
area, and the only thing was to ensure that the troops
holding the line should be ready whenever the storm might
burst. The dispositions now taken up were, therefore,
those which had been finally decided on for the scheme
of defence, and it was arranged that companies should
henceforth always occupy the same positions in order
the better to know their ground. These positions will be
stated in detail later.</p>

<p>So far as the infantry in the line were concerned the
period of suspense was mainly characterised by very hard
work on the defences and by particularly active patrolling.
Each front line post nightly pushed forward to the enemy
wire a listening patrol to give early warning of signs of
the enemy's assembly for attack. On the evening of the
12th March 2/Lieut. G. G. Lewis took a patrol into the
German trenches near Crucifix Corner, but found them
unoccupied. The tour of duty passed quietly, with the
exception of a very severe bombardment with mustard gas
shells, which began at about 7 p.m. on the 15th March and
continued till about 8 a.m. the following morning. At
the time this caused little damage, but the heat of the sun
later in the day accentuated the effects of the gas, and
Lieuts. A. Bath and O. D. Garratt, M.C., 2/Lieuts. G. W.
Fisher, E. A. Ratcliffe and 109 other ranks became
casualties.</p>

<p>Intelligence reports pointed to the probability of the
attack developing on the 12th March; but although
nothing occurred, from this date onwards the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
Division daily stood to arms from one hour before dawn
till 8.30 a.m., while the Divisional and Corps artillery
put a slow barrage on the enemy lines at daybreak. The
"stand-to" order was strictly enforced as far back as the
transport lines and the Quartermaster.</p>

<p>On the 18th the 1/4th Londons were relieved by the
Kensingtons and withdrew in Brigade reserve to Roclincourt,
leaving two platoons in support attached to the
Kensingtons, and one in front trenches attached to the
London Scottish. A rearrangement of the method of
holding the line was now ordered by Corps, and the
necessary changes which were effected on the night of
21st/22nd March resulted in each division holding its
sector with two brigades in line and one in reserve.
Each front line brigade had two battalions in trenches
and one in support. The effect of this in the 56th
Division was to leave the 169th and 168th Brigades
in the line, while the 167th was withdrawn to the support
area.</p>

<p>The 21st March saw the opening of the great German
offensive on the Fifth Army front, but no attack developed
opposite the 56th Division. The day was marked
by very greatly increased artillery activity on the enemy's
part, gas shell being freely used on the Bailleul-Willerval
line. This indication of the imminence of active operations
caused the cancellation of the relief of the 56th Division
by the 62nd. The next day warning was received that
the 2nd Canadian Division would take over the line, but
this order was also subsequently cancelled.</p>

<p>No definite news of the offensive was received during
the 21st March, though it was reported that the enemy
had gained the high ground near Wancourt Tower, and
was likely by his assault on Monchy to lay the Corps
right flank open to attack. Arras was heavily shelled,
and all the civilians were cleared out. St Pol also was
bombarded by a long-range gun, while low-flying Bosche
aeroplanes were over the lines and at night dropped
bombs on Thélus.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 24th the 1/4th Londons returned
to the front line. Aerial reports of great activity behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
the German lines now made it clear that the attack was
imminent, and final preparations for the struggle were
completed. All spare Lewis guns and magazines were
brought up from the transport lines. The men were in
splendid fettle, and the high probability that the long
weeks of suspense would shortly be over increased their
good humour. All were absolutely confident in themselves
and each other, and their only anxiety was as to whether
they would have the good fortune to be in front trenches
to meet the enemy.</p>

<p>At this time Gen. Loch and Lieut.-Col. Marchment
made strong representations that the three front line
posts ought to be much more lightly held, and that the
Company Headquarters in Beatty should be withdrawn
to the Marquis line, on the grounds that it was useless
to pack men into posts only 100 yards from the enemy,
where they were certain to suffer severely from the hostile
bombardment and where they had no room to fight.
These representations were not received favourably by
Corps though the event showed they were well founded.
As it was Lieut.-Col. Marchment moved one platoon from
Oppy Post, but even with this alteration the Marquis line
was too lightly held.</p>

<p>News from the area of battle in the south was still
vague, though it was known that the Fifth Army had been
forced to give a great deal of ground, and that the Third
Army on its left had also retreated, though to a less
degree, and to conform to the movements of its neighbour.
As the day wore on, however, the enemy's pressure on
the Third Army south of the Scarpe increased and by
the 27th he had captured Monchy-le-Preux. It became
evident that he was aiming at a movement to envelop
Arras from the south. A reasonable deduction from
this situation was that the blow at Arras would shortly
develop also on the north of the Scarpe, by means of
an assault on the Vimy Ridge.</p>

<p>In the early hours of the 25th March, shortly after the
1/4th Londons had taken over the line, 2/Lieut. C. H.
Board and Coy. Sergt.-Major Matthews of B Company
were visiting the sentry groups in Beatty Post when two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
of the enemy, who had entered the trench by stealth, tried
to drag the Coy. Sergt.-Major out of it. A scuffle ensued
in which another officer and an N.C.O. joined. The two
Germans unfortunately got away after slightly wounding
both Board and Matthews.</p>

<p>During the day the artillery on both sides became
more active, though no infantry action occurred, and the
men were kept busy in constructing trench blocks and
improving firesteps. The right flank of the 1/4th Londons'
sector had always been regarded as a rather weak spot
in the defence, and in view of the expectation that the
enemy would assault the Vimy Ridge from the south, it
was desirable to provide for the formation by the Battalion
of a defensive flank facing south should this area become
threatened. To this end work was pushed forward in
constructing and improving firesteps in Ouse Alley for
its possible use as a "switch line." This precaution, as
will be seen, was justified by events.</p>

<p>During the evening a report was received of the examination
of a prisoner of the 471st Infantry Regiment,
who had been taken near Mill Post on the previous evening.
This was to the effect that the attack was to be made
on the morning of the 26th, and that the 219th and
23rd Reserve Divisions had been brought forward for the
purpose. These troops were accommodated in the Drocourt-Quéant
line. They had just arrived from Riga and would
attack in conjunction with the 240th and 5th Bavarian
Reserve Divisions. They would assemble in the front
line system and would advance to a depth of four miles
with their right flank on Oppy, then swing round
towards Vimy. Three special divisions would capture
the Vimy Ridge the next day. The 471st Regiment
had already 60 trench mortars in position, and 8 more
trench mortar companies were to arrive on the night
of the 25th; most of the ammunition was already in
the line.</p>

<p>This message, bringing as it did a hope that the wearisome
suspense was at last at an end, was received with
satisfaction, and instructions to prepare for battle were
issued. All night our artillery maintained a heavy fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
on the enemy's supposed assembly positions, while No
Man's Land was occupied by our listening patrols. At
4 a.m. these came in and the heavy artillery placed a slow
barrage on the German front lines. At 4.45 a.m. the
Battalion stood to arms, blocks were lowered in the
communication trenches and all made ready. No attack
developed, and at 7.30 a.m. the order to stand down was
received from Brigade, the remainder of the day passing
comparatively quietly.</p>

<p>In the evening, in response to urgent appeals from
Corps for an identification, all battalions in the line sent
patrols to the enemy trenches to try to get prisoners.
From the 1/4th Londons two parties went forward at
10.30 p.m. after wire-cutting preparations by the field
artillery. 2/Lieut. G. G. Lewis with a platoon of A Company
entered the enemy line opposite Oppy Post, but the
sentry group was heard running away and no bag was
obtained. From C Company 2/Lieut. R. E. Campkin
took two men to the German trenches near Crucifix Corner,
and had a lively little scrap in the dark with the sentry
group. In this case also the Bosche took to their heels,
and, in spite of a good set to with fists, managed to get
away pursued by Campkin. After remaining two hours
in the enemy line both patrols returned bringing some
trench notice boards.</p>

<p>The 27th March passed remarkably quietly, nothing
of interest occurring beyond the movements of a low-flying
Bosche 'plane which appeared to be particularly
interested in our trenches. A relief of the German
division opposite the Battalion was suspected, but the
report was incorrect.</p>

<p>On the night 27th/28th March orders were received
that the XIII Corps boundary was to be extended northwards
as far as the Souchez River, and that the 56th
Division would "side-step" northwards. The side-step
was effected by transferring the Kensingtons from the
right flank of the 1/4th Londons to the left flank, the
Kensingtons taking over two new posts north of the
1/4th Londons from the 8th Canadian Brigade. The gap
thus created on the right flank of the Battalion was filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
by the 169th Brigade, which extended its left flank. Why
this redistribution was effected at the eleventh hour we
do not know: obviously it must have been for some very
important reason. But whatever the cause, the result
was distinctly weakening to the defence. We have already
alluded to the well-recognised risk of the 1/4th Londons'
right flank being laid open, and now at the last moment
the area was occupied by a Battalion entirely strange
to the ground. The relief in fact was not completed
before the battle opened, for when the Bosche barrage
fell on the morning of the 28th March the L.R.B. had not
taken over Bailleul East Post, while a company of the
1st Canadian Rifles in the Brown line was still awaiting
relief. By the courtesy of the Canadian Brigadier this
company was placed under the orders of Brig.-Gen.
Loch.</p>

<p>In addition to this eleventh hour change of dispositions
a certain difficulty appears to have beset the High
Command in reconciling the rôles of the three divisions
composing the Corps, and this resulted in a stream of
orders each of which altered its predecessor. The Corps
order, under which the extension of the 56th Division's
line was carried out, laid down that the Bailleul-Willerval
line (Red line) was to be the line of resistance, and that
the front line system would be regarded as outposts.
Later in the evening the front line system was ordered
to be held at all costs to conform with the 4th Division
on our right; but still later a modification of this
was made on the left of the line in order to conform
to the defensive line of the 3rd Canadian Division
on our left, and the garrison of Arleux Post was
ordered, if heavily attacked, to withdraw to the Arleux
Loop.</p>

<p>The final dispositions therefore provided five lines of
defence, each to be defended at all costs in default of a
Divisional order to withdraw. There were:</p>
<div class="center">
<ol>
  <li>Front line system.</li>
  <li>Red line (Bailleul-Willerval).</li>

<p>During the night 2/Lieut. R. E. Campkin with two men
of C Company again crossed No Man's Land and returned
shortly before 3 a.m. on the 28th March reporting that
he had seen long lines of men carrying up to the enemy
front line what appeared to be large biscuit tins&mdash;doubtless
the trench mortar ammunition coming in. Evidently this
was The Day!</p>

<p>At 3 a.m. on the 28th March the enemy opened an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
intense high explosive shell fire on Bow Trench, Ouse
Alley and Rear Battalion Headquarters, as well as on all
the rearward defensive posts. This bombardment, which
continued throughout the day, was at first mingled with
mustard gas. The forward area was hardly affected by
this shelling except for the fact that the wind carried the
gas eastward over the front line posts, the garrisons of
which had to wear masks for over an hour.</p>

<p>At 5.40 a.m. a terrific trench mortar fire fell on the
forward posts doing very severe damage, and causing
many casualties. Ouse Alley and the Earl-Marquis line
at first escaped this, though later the area of bombardment
was extended and they received a full share of it.</p>

<p>A strictly chronological account of an action such as
this, in which different parts of the Battalion became
involved in the fight at varying hours, is almost an impossibility
if the reader is to glean anything but the
most confused impression of what occurred. We propose,
therefore, to deal first of all with the fight for the front
line posts gradually working our narrative westward.</p>

<p>The S.O.S. signal was received in Battalion Headquarters
from Oppy Post by wire at 7.15 a.m., and a few
moments later flares were sent up from Wood and Beatty.
The signal was repeated backwards to Brigade by Battalion
Headquarters. "We stood on top," writes Lieut.-Col.
Marchment, "to have a look round but could see very
little as it was not fully light. We could, however, hear
a pleasant noise&mdash;very heavy rifle fire!"</p>

<p>Oppy Post on the left had been very badly knocked
about by the trench mortaring and the garrison seriously
reduced before the enemy came over. A gallant attempt
at resistance was put up and rifle and Lewis gun fire were
opened as soon as the attacking lines made their appearance.
One Lewis gun team was seen from the rear to
have climbed on to the parapet, and the gun was being
fired from the hip. But it was hopeless from the first.
The enemy lines were very close, and by sheer weight of
numbers the Post was quickly swamped. Of a garrison
of 2 officers and 48 other ranks but 1 officer (2/Lieut.
Athey) and 5 other ranks were able to make their way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
back to the Marquis line which they did by way of Boyne
Trench.</p>

<p>On the right Beatty Post had suffered from the
trench mortar fire more severely than any, and by the
time the Germans appeared its trenches were practically
effaced. The attackers appeared in fairly close formation,
and in considerable depth, some of the leading wave firing
rifle grenades from the hip. Apparently the enemy's
trench mortar preparation, severe as it had been, had not
dealt effectively with our wire, for the leading wave of
attackers was delayed in getting through it, causing those
following to bunch up to it. The rapid rifle and Lewis
gun fire opened by the garrison of the post was thus able
to inflict very severe loss. For about fifteen minutes the
garrison stoutly held its own, but at the end of that time
it was found that the enemy had already swept over the
posts to the right held by the L.R.B., and was working
into Marine Trench and Ouse Alley in great numbers.
Again sheer weight of numbers made further resistance
impossible, and 2/Lieut. G. R. Pitman brought the six
surviving men back to the Marquis line over the open,
leaving 2 officers (Capt. E. E. Spicer and 2/Lieut.
Coombes) and 78 other ranks fallen at their posts.</p>

<p>In the centre a magnificent stand was made by the
garrison of Wood Post under Lieut. H. F. Dade and
2/Lieut. H. O. Morris. The night position of the post
had been changed a few days before the battle, and the
German trench mortar preparation therefore fell harmlessly
on the former position. When the trench mortar
fire ceased the enemy was seen advancing in an extended
line over the open ground left of the Wood and coming
through the Wood in groups of about 10 men 50 yards
apart. This line was followed by groups of about 30 men
some 200 yards in rear. The whole garrison (2 officers, 45
other ranks and 2 Lewis guns) at once opened a heavy
fire which undoubtedly caused very severe loss to the
enemy. A party of Germans tried to force the block in
the trench leading from the new post to the old, but they
were effectively disposed of with rifle grenades. For a
full hour this gallant garrison held their own, completely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>checking the enemy in the wood. On the right, however,
the enemy had, as already recounted, swept over Beatty
Post and was now working his way round Wood Post from
the south. Ammunition and bombs were beginning to
run short. After a consultation Dade and Morris decided
that the position was no longer tenable, and they withdrew
their men along Bedford Row and Boyne Trench to
the Marquis line. This withdrawal was skilfully executed,
the move of the riflemen down Boyne Trench being covered
by Lewis guns in Bedford Row. That the garrison held
their own to the last is evidenced by the fact that before
the post was finally evacuated the Headquarters dugout
was in the hands of the enemy, while our own artillery
was already shelling the post. The defence of Wood Post
cost 25 casualties in other ranks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_b_400fp.jpg" width="500" height="363" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">The Defence of Arras, March 1918</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The value of the defence of Wood Post can hardly be
overestimated. Apart from the heavy losses which the
fire of its garrison undoubtedly inflicted on the enemy, it
is certain that its prolonged resistance saved the Marquis
line from being overrun in the vicinity of Advanced
Battalion Headquarters.</p>

<p>As soon as Williams reported the men back from Oppy
Post Lieut.-Col. Marchment had a 6-inch howitzer battery
turned on to Oppy Wood.</p>

<p>The forward posts having fallen, the Marquis line became
almost immediately engaged, and Capt. H. N. Williams
(A Company) displayed great qualities of leadership in his
defence of the position. We cannot do better than to relate
this phase of the battle in the words of the official account
of the action submitted by Lieut.-Col. Marchment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Marquis line easily held up the advancing
enemy after the posts had gone. On the right the
enemy was strongly established in the Earl line and
Viscount Street about fifteen minutes after zero.
Major F. A. Phillips at once gave orders to 2/Lieut.
O. C. Hudson, whose platoon was in the Marquis line
astride Ouse Alley, to form the defensive flank at once.
This had been rehearsed previously and consisted not
only in manning the block in Ouse Alley to the front,
but also in Earl to the right, and manning firesteps
facing to the right along Ouse Alley. 2/Lieut. Hudson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
maintained this position with great gallantry and
inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy, whom he
caught in enfilade as they broke through over Earl
to Viscount Street. The defensive flank was prolonged
by Headquarter details who continued on the
firestep in Ouse Alley and held a block near the Aid
Post in South Duke Street.</p>

<p>At about 9.30 a.m. a strong party was seen working
up Ouse Alley from Viscount Street towards Forward
Battalion Headquarters. Major F. A. Phillips at once
attacked over the open with about 20 Headquarter
details, the men following most gallantly under heavy
fire. The enemy were ejected and a block established
in Ouse Alley towards Viscount Street. A block
was established here and successfully defended with
grenades by a party under Sergt. Udall.</p>

<p>In the centre of the Marquis line the attack was not
pressed until the Wood Post Garrison had withdrawn.
After this the enemy gradually built up a large volume
of rifle fire from Oppy Wood, but was prevented from
debouching by well-directed rifle and Lewis gun fire
from the Marquis line. Rifle grenades were also
used on New Cut and Baker Street where the enemy
had established himself.</p>

<p>On the left of the Marquis line excellent targets
were presented on the left of the Wood, the Lewis
gun in the bank (near the junction of Clarence Trench
and Kent Road) doing most excellent work.</p>

<p>During the next three hours the enemy twice broke
into the line near Boyne, but was thrown out, leaving
a good many dead in the trench. Rifle and Lewis
gun fire was opened whenever a good target presented
itself, and a large number of dead were seen between
Wood and Beale Trenches.</p>

<p>Later on the enemy broke in on the left from
Clarence Trench. The Lewis gun on the left had
finished its ammunition, but reinforced by a few men,
the team ejected the enemy with rifle fire and grenades.</p>

<p>Thus, at about 11 a.m., the forward troops were
holding the Marquis line beating off attacks to the
front and holding a block on the left. On the right,
although the enemy pressure was considerable, he was
held up splendidly in Earl and South Duke Street
and in front and behind in Ouse Alley; the enemy
holding Viscount Street on the right and pushing on
towards the Red line.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p>

<p>During the whole of this fight information as to the
situation came in to Rear Battalion Headquarters rapidly,
thanks to a buried cable, and throughout the battle
communication was maintained with the troops in front
and with Brigade Headquarters and the artillery in rear.
Advantage of this was taken when definite news of the
fall of the post line was received, and the artillery barrage
was dropped to conform to the situation, Earl Trench
being shelled with good effect.</p>

<p>We must now turn for a moment to the course of events
in the rearward area. The enemy's preparatory bombardment
had fallen heavily on Bow Trench, but the
garrison (D Company, Cooper) was kept in dugouts,
sentries being changed each half-hour, and few casualties
were sustained. At 5 a.m. the blocks in Ouse Alley were
lowered, and rum and extra S.A.A. issued to the men.
On the S.O.S. signal being received the trench was manned;
and at the same time Lieut.-Col. Marchment sent the
Headquarter Company round to join D Company, retaining
with him only a few signallers to work the line, two clerks
and a few scouts, in addition to Boutall (Adjutant), Lorden
(Works Officer) and Padre Green "to create a calm atmosphere."
Lorden was hit here at about 7.45 a.m.</p>

<p>From about 8 a.m. the Headquarters area was quite
in the air. The front line system in the adjoining sector
on the right (169th Brigade) had gone, with the exception
of Towy Post held by the Queen's Westminsters; and the
Bosche had worked up the valley on the left and was also
for a time in Ouse Alley, and attacking Bailleul East Post
in the Red line (held by the London Scottish).</p>

<p>For a time trouble was caused by low-flying enemy
aeroplanes, but these went back as soon as our own R.E. 8's
appeared. Good contact work was done throughout the
day with these machines which called at intervals for
flares. Luckily all flares were carried on the men, and
they were thus available to show our positions to the
aeroplanes. At one time the Battalion code and position
call, Q.J.B., was sent to the contact aeroplane by Lucas
Lamp worked by Sergt. Hurst, and satisfactorily received.</p>

<p>At about 9 a.m. the enemy was in Viscount Trench,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
and as stragglers from the L.R.B. reported that he was
also working down Ouse Alley, D Company was ordered
to despatch one platoon to man Ouse Alley forward of
Bow Trench. This was quickly done, and the men, taking
up positions on the firesteps facing south-east, were able
to engage small parties of the enemy who appeared over
the crest in front of Bailleul East Post.</p>

<p>Later in the morning when news was received of the
severe odds against which the gallant Marquis line garrison
was struggling, the remainder of D Company was ordered
to bomb up Ouse Alley to try to join hands with Major
Phillips and thus complete the defensive flank. At the
same time a carrying party was detailed from Headquarters
to carry S.A.A. to the front line should D Company
succeed. The place of D Company in Bow Trench was
taken by two platoons of the London Scottish placed at
Lieut.-Col. Marchment's disposal.</p>

<p>The bombing attack was pushed forward for some 400
yards. Enemy opposition was not very severe and about a
dozen were killed. The Germans were, however, continuing
to press forward over the open from the right and it seemed
likely that D Company would get cut off. A block was
therefore made in Ouse Alley which was held by a few
men, while another small party manned the firesteps to
the right to engage the advancing enemy. The remainder
of D Company moved over the open in the valley north
of Ouse Alley towards Boyne Dump to carry S.A.A. to
the Marquis line, taking full advantage of the ground.</p>

<p>By 11.30 a.m. the situation of the Marquis line troops
had become precarious in the extreme. The Germans in
Oppy Wood were being reinforced and were developing
a considerable volume of fire from that direction. The
right and right rear of the position were almost enveloped
and an attack was being launched against the left flank.
Bombs and ammunition were giving out. It seemed
clear that further resistance could only lead to useless loss
of life. Influenced by these weighty considerations Major
Phillips, after a consultation with his senior officers,
decided to try to save the remnants of the garrison by a
withdrawal to the Red line. The only available trench<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
for withdrawal, Ouse Alley, was, however, already occupied
by the enemy in rear of the position, and the valley from
Boyne Dump on the left offered the only loophole of
escape from the closing pincers. Lieut.-Col. Marchment
writes of this withdrawal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The withdrawal was witnessed by myself from my
headquarters. I watched it through my glasses. It was
carried out in a very steady and orderly way, the men
leaving in groups of about a dozen. Although exposed to
heavy fire from the front and flanks, they made excellent
use of the ground and had few casualties.</p></div>

<p>The men of D Company, who were meanwhile carrying
S.A.A. up to the Marquis line, met the survivors
returning and covered their withdrawal.</p>

<p>It is hard to find adequate words in praise of this
gallant defence and skilful and well-timed withdrawal.
All ranks alike behaved with the greatest spirit under
very trying circumstances.</p>

<p>A great loss was suffered in this defence in the capture
by the enemy of the Regimental Aid Post. Capt.
Maloney, the M.O. was a most popular man in the
Battalion, and Sergt. Rossington and the two orderlies,
Palmer and Simpson, had all done excellent work. By
an irony of fate 2/Lieut. Morris, who had done such good
work in the defence of Wood Post earlier in the morning,
was hit later, and was having his wounds dressed in the
Aid Post when it was captured.</p>

<p>Major F. A. Phillips who, at Forward Headquarters,
was in charge of the whole defence of the forward system,
did excellent work. He was continually up and down
the lines encouraging the men, and was able to keep
Rear Battalion Headquarters constantly in touch with
the rapid changes in the situation.</p>

<p>The enemy was now in great force in Viscount Street
and was beginning to bomb heavily down Ouse Alley,
while he showed increasing signs of strength on the ridge
to the right of that trench. The party of D Company in
Ouse Alley was therefore withdrawn as soon as the survivors
of the Marquis line garrison had reached Bow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
Trench, to avoid the risk of being cut off. Later the
enemy appeared in great strength against the block in
Ouse Alley forward of Bow Trench. This block was defended
by a "slit" cut in the side of Ouse Alley which
was covered by a Lewis gun post in Bow Trench and
seven of the enemy were killed by Lewis gun fire.</p>

<p>As soon as the Battalion was concentrated in Bow
Trench and the Red line, the artillery barrage was dropped
to a line about 400 yards in front of Bow Trench, and
arrangements were made to increase it to intense should
the S.O.S. signal be sent up from Battalion Headquarters.</p>

<p>The enemy skirmishers having been definitely checked
the situation now became quieter, and for the next hour
there was a distinct lull in the battle.</p>

<p>The Kensingtons on the left had not been attacked
but had withdrawn to the Red line to conform to the
1/4th Londons' new position.</p>

<p>In Towy Post, the extreme right of the Divisional
front, the Queen's Westminsters had put up a most
gallant fight, but the remainder of the 169th Brigade front
had rapidly been swamped by weight of enemy numbers,
and in this sector the 169th Brigade troops were thrown
back to the Red line while the Wood Post garrison was
still holding its ground.</p>

<p>The development of this great German attack was a
remarkable confirmation of the statement which had been
made by the prisoner captured on the 24th March. All
the troops mentioned by him were identified in the course
of the fighting. On the 1/4th Londons' front two German
regiments were identified: the 249th I. Regt. at Oppy
Post, and the 10th R.I. Regt. in the shape of a gentleman
who broke into Sergt. Plumbley's canteen in Ouse Alley.
But having armed himself with a tin of pineapple this
luckless marauder fell into the arms of D Company
bombing up the trench!</p>

<p>Eleven German divisions took part in this great battle,
but they were all checked by the divisions holding the
line, the 56th and 4th north of the Scarpe and the 3rd
and 15th south of it. That the almost complete failure
of the enemy on the 28th March was a severe blow to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
German High Command there can be no doubt, and
Ludendorff says, "It was an established fact that the
enemy's resistance was beyond our strength."</p>

<p>The regiment has every reason to be proud of its
defence this day. For over four hours it retained the
front line system under the weight of heavy shell fire and
repeated attacks by vastly superior numbers, and, when
finally it was forced to give ground to avoid extinction,
it withdrew fighting. The casualties were heavy, but
considering the enormous service rendered the price paid
was not unduly great.</p>

<p>At about 4 p.m. the enemy began to shell the Red line
rather heavily, but no infantry attack matured. Shortly
afterwards the 1/4th Londons were withdrawn, and by
6 p.m. were under cover of the Railway Embankment
north-east of Bailleul, reorganised in two companies
(Cooper and Williams), S.A.A. was replenished and
arrangements made to man the Brown line and posts
south of the Bailleul Road should the enemy break
through the Red line. Bow Trench had been handed
over to the London Scottish.</p>

<p>The experience of this battle showed the need for
holding front line posts lightly, and purely for observation
purposes. The uselessness of locking up large garrisons
in them&mdash;unless they can be effectively concealed as in
the case of Wood Post&mdash;was clearly demonstrated. The
system of trench blocks to which much thought had
previously been devoted fully proved its value, while the
advantage of rehearsing companies in the rôles they may
be expected to play, and especially of acquainting all
ranks with the "overland" routes within the area was
much in evidence.</p>

<p>The casualties sustained by the 1/4th Londons in this
action were:</p>

<div class="hangindent8">

<p>Officers: Capt. E. E. Spicer, 2/Lieuts. R. E. Campkin, H. T.
Hannay and H. V. Coombes, killed; Capt. A. M.
Duthie, D.S.O., and Lieut. H. M. Lorden, wounded;
Capt. Maloney, 2/Lieuts. C. W. Denning (attached
to 168th L.T.M. Battery), H. O. Morris and C. S.
Richards, captured.</p>

<p>N.C.O.'s and men: 15 killed, 43 wounded and 168 missing.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>

<p>Decorations were awarded to the following:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Lieut.-Col. A. F. Marchment, M.C., and Major F. A. Phillips, the
D.S.O.; Capts. A. M. Duthie, D.S.O., T. B. Cooper, M.M.,
and H. N. Williams, the M.C.; C.S.M. T. Lock, M.M., the

and A. J. Deadman, and Ptes. W. A. G. Battershall, P. C.
Swinchatt, A. J. Sellars and J. R. Phillips, the M.M.</p></div>

<p>During the 29th March the 1/4th Londons remained in
Brigade support. Much movement was observed in the
enemy's lines during the morning, and our artillery was
active in anticipation of a renewal of the attack, but as
the day wore on it became evident that the enemy was
engaged in relieving the attacking divisions. That evening
at 7 p.m. the Battalion handed over its trenches to the
87th Canadian Battalion (4th Canadian Division) and
marched out to billets at Mont St Eloy, arriving there
at 2 a.m. on the 30th March.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

THE 1/4TH AND 2/4TH BATTALIONS DURING THE SUMMER
MONTHS OF 1918--THE RESERVE BATTALION, 1918</h2>


<p>In the preceding chapters we have endeavoured to describe
the part played by each of the battalions in resisting the
mighty German offensive.</p>

<p>As we have seen this gigantic thrust was finally brought
to a standstill in front of Amiens at the end of April,
while the enemy's hopes in the Arras area had been finally
shattered by the magnificent resistance of the 28th March.
The German offensive capabilities were, however, by no
means exhausted; and in the north the enemy once more
taxed the British resources to the uttermost in the Battle
of the Lys, which raged from the 7th to the 30th April
and bent our lines back to Hazebrouck. With this action,
or rather series of actions, we are not directly concerned
as the 4th London Regiment had no part in it, and we
may therefore turn at once to consider the situation in
which the British Armies found themselves when the
German attacks were finally spent.</p>

<p>The enormous weight of the German attacks of March
and April had involved practically the whole of the British
divisions in France, and all were in consequence seriously
reduced in numbers and sorely in need of rest and reorganisation.
The magnificent efforts which were made
at home to replace the lost guns and other material are
well known and were of immediate effect; but the task
of filling up the gaps in personnel was necessarily a longer
one, especially having regard to the waning man-power of
the Empire and its commitments in other theatres of war.
Moreover, after their arrival in France it was necessary
for reinforcements to be thoroughly assimilated into their
new units before active work could be expected of them.
The serious depletion of force at this time is illustrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
by the fact that after temporarily writing off as fighting
units no fewer than 8 divisions, and handing over to
the French a further 5 at the urgent request of Marshal
Foch, there remained but 45&mdash;and most of these much
reduced in numbers&mdash;available for service on the British
front.</p>

<p>The enemy's successes had, of course, cost him dear,
but it was believed to be by no means beyond the bounds
of possibility that he would make yet another effort to
achieve a decisive victory, and the position was thus full
of anxiety for G.H.Q.</p>

<p>In the meantime the American Army was being
poured into France as rapidly as the whole available
mercantile marine of the British Empire could bring it
across the Atlantic, but here again it was a question of
time before these well-trained but inexperienced troops
would be sufficiently valuable and numerous to turn the
scale against Germany.</p>

<p>The story of the months of May, June and July 1918
is one of preparation, in which the British Armies were
being gradually reorganised and used in active defence
of the new positions until an equilibrium of strength
between the Allies and the enemy was attained, and it was
possible once more for the Allies to take the offensive and
roll back the tide of invasion in the most remarkable series
of victories which the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>We propose, therefore, to deal in this chapter, as
briefly as possible, with the operations during this period
of reorganisation of each Battalion in turn, until the
opening of the Allied offensive in August 1918.</p>


<h3><em>The 1/4th Battalion</em></h3>

<p>Arriving at Mont St Eloy early in the morning of the
31st March 1918 the 1/4th Londons settled down to a
few days of so-called rest, days which, for officers at least,
are usually quite as hard work as those spent in battle.
Companies have to be reorganised and fresh "specialists"
trained to their duties, the completion of the men's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
clothing and equipment, and replenishment of all company
stores have to be looked to, in addition to a large
amount of clerical work in writing up the official account
of the battle and in submitting names for awards, mention
in despatches and promotion. The Battalion on this
occasion was fortunate in getting the gaps in its ranks
rapidly filled. On the 2nd and 3rd April two drafts
arrived numbering together 420 fully trained N.C.O.'s
and men. Fine drafts which later did gallant service,
but which transformed the camp into a mild imitation
of the Tower of Babel, for among them could be traced
the accents of London, Kent, Surrey, Berkshire, the
broader dialects of Yorkshire, Cheshire, Lancashire and
Wiltshire, and even the unmistakable tones of Scotland
and South Wales. Regulars, Territorials and New Armies
were all represented, and the rejuvenated Battalion provided
a living example of the unity of the Motherland in
a great cause.</p>

<p>This great accession enabled an immediate reconstruction
of the four companies to take place, and
they were accordingly reformed and the reinforcements
absorbed, A Company under Capt. H. N. Williams, M.C.,
B under Capt. R. S. B. Simmonds, C under Capt. S. J.
Barkworth, M.C., M.M., and D under Capt. T. B. Cooper,
M.C., M.M.</p>

<p>The troops were largely kept busy in digging new lines
of defence round Haut Avesnes, and all were much
encouraged by the congratulations received from G.H.Q.,
Army and Corps on their recent great stand.</p>

<p>Divisional rests, however, have ever proved a snare
and a delusion, and those who count on prolonged peace
in billets are invariably disappointed. In spite of its so
recent gruelling the morale of the Division was high, and
on the 6th April it was called upon again to go into the line,
this time in the XVII Corps (Fergusson), but still in the
First Army, which now extended as far south as Neuville-Vitasse.
After spending the night 5th/6th April at Villers
au Bois the 1/4th Londons marched on the afternoon of
the 6th to Agnez lez Duisans, and proceeded the following
afternoon to Ronville Caves. The march through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
streets of Arras in the dusk was a great surprise to
those who had known this pleasant little city even as
recently as the late summer of 1917. The civilians were
now all gone, hotels and shops were shut and scarcely a
house had escaped the German shell fire. The beautiful
Cathedral had met the same ghastly fate as that of
Albert, and the Levis and Schramm barracks were but
ghosts of their former selves.</p>

<p>In Ronville Caves, a remarkable series of underground
chalk quarries, the Battalion found dry and adequate
quarters. The caves are of considerable extent, the limits
east and west being a crater in old No Man's Land and
Levis barracks; but, lighted by electricity and tolerably
ventilated, they formed quite healthy billets and, in the
wet weather then prevalent, far superior to bivouacs
or trenches.</p>

<p>The trenches now to be taken over by the 56th from
the 1st Canadian Division lay south of the Arras-Cambrai
Road just in front of the village of Tilloy, for as far as this
had the German offensive bent our lines back. The front
line, Tilloy Trench, ran between Tilloy and the Bois des
Bœufs and then southwards towards Neuville-Vitasse,
roughly following what had formerly been the east side
of the famous German redoubt, The Harp. In rear of
the front trench were successively Tilloy Support, View
Trench and Tilloy Reserve. Communication trenches
were Scottish Avenue, Stokes Lane, Fusilier Lane and
Wye Lane, the last named forming the right boundary
of the sector. The front and support trenches lay on the
forward slope of the hill well under observation from the
enemy lines. View Trench was on the reverse slope of the
hill, and probably acquired its name in the days when its
defenders wore field-grey and looked in the other direction:
for us it was well sited with a good field of fire of about
200 yards. Trenches, wire and dugouts were fair. The
fact that but a few days earlier this had been a back area
was forced on one's attention, for the line ran through
ruined Nissen hut camps and horse standings, while in
the German front line opposite stood the remains of a
Y.M.C.A. hut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>

<p>After four days of working parties at Ronville, in which
the Battalion was digging a new line, Telegraph Hill
Switch, the 1/4th Londons relieved the 8th Middlesex in
the line. This tour of duty lasted six days during which
the enemy remained inactive on this front, but which saw
the outbreak of the Battle of the Lys to which we have
already alluded. To those who knew the Neuve Chapelle
area it seemed strange to hear of "fighting in Riez Bailleul
and Laventie," "the struggle for Estaires," "the fall of
Merville." Ruined though some of these places had been
in 1916, they had afforded shelter to many hundreds of
1/4th London men, and it was now impossible to refrain
from wondering what had become of the villagers who had
hitherto clung to their homes, and especially of the little
children.</p>

<p>On the last day in the line, the 19th, a raid on a large
scale was carried out by one company of the London
Scottish on the right, and one platoon of the 1/4th Londons
on the left, with the object of advancing the outpost line
on the whole sector, and establishing it an average of 500
yards in front of Tilloy Trench. The assaulting platoon
was drawn from C Company under 2/Lieut. E. L. Mills,
M.C., and afterwards (Mills having been hit) under
2/Lieut. J. L. Backhouse. Zero was at 4.30 a.m., and
eight minutes later the 1/4th London platoon rushed
their objective after Stokes Mortar preparation. Unfortunately
the enemy garrison bolted and no identification
was obtained, though they left a machine-gun and
many documents and maps in our hands. The London
Scottish also reached their objective and touch was
gained with them. This advanced line was held all day
under German artillery fire, which steadily increased until
the Battalion was compelled to call for protective fire
from our guns in retaliation.</p>

<p>After 7 p.m. the enemy launched some heavy bombing
attacks against the new positions. These were vigorously
resisted. A withdrawal to the original line was, however,
ordered by Brigade, and by 8 p.m. all the assaulting
platoons were back. A good deal of loss was undoubtedly
inflicted on the enemy, and the effect of this minor opera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>tion
on the spirit of the men fully justified its execution.
Five N.C.O.'s and men of the Battalion were killed and
24 wounded.</p>

<p>Late that night the Battalion handed over its trenches
to the 1/2nd Londons and withdrew in support to Ronville
Caves, moving in the evening of the 20th April to Dainville
in Divisional reserve.</p>

<p>About this period the 1/4th Londons were unfortunate
in losing Major F. A. Phillips, D.S.O., who had been an
able second in command for nearly eight months. He
was much out of health principally through having
swallowed rather too much mustard gas at Oppy, and
he did not rejoin the Battalion. His place was taken
by Major R. B. Marshall, 8th East Surrey Regiment,
whose battalion had been disbanded in January. Capt.
Maloney's duties as Medical Officer had been taken for
a few weeks by Capt. J. Ridley, M.C., and subsequently
by Capt. E. Woodyeat, a retired naval surgeon,
who had served in 1915 and 1916 with the Coldstream
Guards.</p>

<p>Casualties in April were light beyond those sustained
during the raid of the 19th. Lieut. L. E. Ballance was
wounded this month. On the 24th April a draft of officers
joined as follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Lieut. J. W. Price, 2/Lieuts. H. W. Attenborrow, C. L.
Henstridge, A. Holloway, C. R. Mason, J. D. Miller, A. H.
Millstead, W. P. Humphrey and F. S. Wise.</p>

<p>2/Lieut. R. T. Stevenson (5th Londons); 2/Lieuts. S. Blackhurst,
M.C., A. F. Potter, J. A. Voskule, W. Roughton (7th
Londons); 2/Lieut. A. M. Bullock (15th Londons).</p></div>

<p>On the 24th April Major-Gen. Dudgeon fell sick and
went to hospital. He had commanded the Division since
August 1917 and brought it through two of its most
successful actions. A few days later Major-Gen. Hull
resumed the command.</p>

<p>On the night 3rd/4th May the Divisional front was
extended northwards as far as the Arras-Douai railway,
the additional frontage being taken over from the 1st
Canadian Division. Thereafter the sector was held with
two brigades in line (each with two battalions in trenches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
and one in support), and one brigade in reserve. Of the
reserve brigade two battalions were billeted at Dainville
and one at Berneville.</p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons now settled down to their share of
the routine of working this sector, and through May and
June were in and out of the trenches, in line, in support
and in reserve alternately, the tours of duty varying
between six and nine days. These summer weeks form
on the whole a pleasant memory for all who passed through
them. The general situation was indeed grave, and
though for G.H.Q. the summer months of 1918 must
have been a period of unceasing anxiety, the infantryman
in the line saw life from a different angle. The trenches
were comfortable, the weather good, the men well fed
and clothed. Mornings in the trenches were spent in
hard work on the defences, afternoons in resting, evenings
under a summer moon divided between digging and
wiring. With the added spice of patrolling and raiding,
in which a lot of useful work was achieved, and the enemy
kept well on the alert, and wishing he was not opposite
to the 56th Division, the tours of duty in line passed
pleasantly enough with very few casualties. The Battalion
was in fine fettle and in good conceit with itself, a wholesome
feeling which scored heavily when the time came
for the final advance.</p>

<p>The enemy's chief activity was shell fire, and at times
this developed to great intensity. On the 27th May in
particular, when the 1/4th Londons were in trenches, a
very heavy bombardment, high explosive and mustard
gas together, burst on the area in the early morning. The
Battalion stood to and prepared to receive an attack, but
no infantry movement occurred, and it subsequently
transpired that the disturbance was to cover an enemy
raid on the division on our right. For a time most of the
Battalion had made up their minds that they were about
to fight. The Londoner is full of superstition, and this
day the Battalion was to have boiled rabbit for dinner.
Boiled rabbit had figured in the menu on the 28th March!...
Throughout the day the enemy artillery carried out
hurricane bombardments of various parts of the sector,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
and it was no surprise to learn later that his offensive
against Rheims had broken out.</p>

<p>During the period under review the Battalion paid five
visits to the trenches at Tilloy, with one tour of three days
in Arras, spent in heavy working parties carrying wire
to Telegraph Hill and digging, and six days in support at
St Sauveur similarly occupied.</p>

<p>Rests in Divisional reserve were spent at Dainville, in
which much good training work was carried out and the
routine broken occasionally by excellent sports meetings,
shooting matches and concerts. In connection with the
concerts we must again refer to the Quartermaster's string
band. This excellent orchestra had given its first public
performance at St Aubin in January 1918. Receiving
every encouragement from the Colonel and the keenest
support from the Padre, this band had had an unbroken
career of success and given the greatest pleasure to all
ranks of the Battalion. At Church Parades when out
of the line the band always played the hymns and
voluntaries, and many a shattered barn in the villages
behind the trenches has re-echoed with the strains of the
1/4th London string band. The keenness and pride of
the Quartermaster in his band were as delightful to observe
as his remarks when a cornet player was put out of action
at Oppy were startling. A portable harmonium was
purchased to complete the equipment, and when demobilisation
broke the band up early in 1919, this harmonium,
decorated with the names of all the villages of France
and Belgium in which the orchestra had performed, was
presented to the Padre for use in his parish at home.</p>

<p>The general efficiency of the Battalion at this period
reached a remarkably high pitch, of which everyone
associated with it had reason to be thoroughly proud.
It was well equipped, well drilled and disciplined, and a
fine fighting unit. This efficiency was not confined to the
fighting ranks. At an inspection of the Battalion Transport
(Lieut. G. V. Lawrie), the Divisional Commander
was so impressed with its turn-out that his remarks were
circulated to other units as an example. A fine fighting
battalion cannot exist without fine administration, and
this was supplied in full measure by the Adjutant (Boutall),
and by the rear Headquarters under Mosely, Stanbridge,
Faulkner, the Quartermaster, and Lawrie, whose unceasing
service to the fighting ranks were of immeasurable
value.</p>

<p>Faulkner was a man of peculiarly lovable disposition.
"Le gros papa," as he was known to the little children in
Dainville, forms in the minds of many French peasants a
picture of all that is kind and chivalrous in the British
soldier. Mosely writes: "Many is the night when the
Huns were dropping bombs on the village"&mdash;by no means
an infrequent occurrence&mdash;"that Faulkner has deliberately
set himself to amuse a family of youngsters and keep them
screaming with laughter so that their merriment should
drown the noise of the explosions."</p>

<p>The following officers joined the Battalion during May,
June and July:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Capt. H. A. T. Hewlett; Lieut. G. E. Stanbridge (recalled from
six months' home duty "on exchange"); 2/Lieuts. A. W.
Chignell, T. Yoxall and G. H. Sylvester.</p></div>

<p>In the early days of June the influenza epidemic began
to make its ravages, but the Battalion suffered comparatively
little. No men were allowed to rejoin in the line
from back areas, but were kept at Berneville until the
Battalion came out of the trenches. Casualties for May,
June and July were very light. 2/Lieuts. W. P. Humphrey
and T. H. Mawby were killed, 2/Lieut. A. W. Chignell
wounded, and about 12 N.C.O.'s and men killed and 40
wounded.</p>

<p>Early in July Capt. and Adjt. W. J. Boutall, M.C.,
was appointed to 168th Brigade Headquarters as Assistant
Staff Captain, and his duties in the Battalion were assumed
by Capt. S. J. Barkworth, M.C., M.M. Boutall had filled
the appointment of Adjutant since September 1916 with
conspicuous success. His organising ability was high
and the standard of his work throughout had been excellent.
C Company was taken over about the same time
by Capt. H. A. T. Hewlett. 2/Lieut. F. S. Wise was
seconded to the Machine-gun Corps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 13th July the 56th Division was relieved in the
line by the 1st Canadian Division, and passed into Corps
reserve. The 1/4th Londons, who had already been in
billets at Dainville for a week, moved to Lattre St Quentin,
and during the ensuing fortnight further changes of
stations followed each other with rapidity. The Battalion
was quartered successively at Grand Rullecourt, Tincques
and Marqueffles Farm, the days being occupied with
training interspersed with sports and games. While
the Battalion was at Tinques the railway station was
visited on the night of the 17th July by enemy aircraft,
which dropped eight bombs, but caused no loss of
personnel.</p>

<p>The last night of July found the Division once more
taking over the Tilloy trenches from the Canadians,
the 1/4th Londons being at St Sauveur in Brigade
support until the 4th August, when they relieved the
Kensingtons in the front trenches. On the 8th August,
the opening day of the great British advance, the
Battalion was relieved by the London Scottish and
withdrew to billets in Arras. At this point, therefore, we
may leave the 1/4th Battalion until the time comes
to deal with its rôle in the great battles of August
and September 1918.</p>


<h3><em>The 2/4th Battalion</em></h3>

<p>The experience of the 2/4th Battalion during the
summer months was very similar to that of the 1/4th
Battalion.</p>

<p>The Battalion spent the whole period in the area of
the Amiens defences, where the Germans had penetrated
most deeply into our positions. The Amiens defences
were now far in rear of the old 1916 line, and the work
involved in constructing new defences in what, up to five
weeks earlier, had been a line of communication area was
immense. Shell hole defences had to be linked into continuous
trench lines, provided with support and reserve
lines and communication trenches, furnished with dugouts
and shelters, and defended with wire entanglements.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
This formed the greater part of the Battalion's work when
in the line; but it certainly laboured during these months
under disadvantages which the 1/4th Battalion did not
suffer. The upheaval of the British organisation had been
much more widely extended in the Amiens area than it
had been in the vicinity of Arras, where the withdrawal of
our forces had been comparatively shallow, and for a
time "back-of-the-line" organisation was inevitably weak.
Billets were few and bad, and for the most part the
Battalion bivouacked when out of the line. The same
opportunities of resting during periods spent in reserve
did not, therefore, occur.</p>

<p>We have also recorded that the casualties suffered by
the 1/4th Battalion at Oppy were made good promptly by
a veteran draft which was thoroughly absorbed into the
unit during the period of waiting for the final advance.
The 2/4th Battalion, which had been more knocked about
in the great battles of March and April, was reinforced
very slowly, and indeed its losses of the early part of
the year were never completely replaced. Such reinforcements
as it did receive consisted chiefly of immature
youths from home&mdash;all endowed with magnificent spirit
and courage, but by the nature of the case, less valuable
soldiers until they had had a good deal of training in the
line. The recuperation of the 2/4th Battalion was thus
effected under not the most favourable conditions: a
consideration which should count in their favour when we
come later to consider the victories they helped to gain in
August and September.</p>

<p>A few days of rest in the St Riquier area were allowed
the 58th Division after relief from the action at Cachy.
The 2/4th Londons were billeted at Le Plessiel between
the 27th April and the 6th May, and though no large
drafts were received, the accessions of strength were
sufficient to allow of a four-company organisation being
retained. These were organised: A under Capt. F. J.
Griffiths, B under Capt. G. H. Hetley, C under Capt.
W. C. Morton, M.C., and D under 2/Lieut. E. V. Grimsdell.
Ribands were awarded to those who had recently been
decorated, by the Divisional Commander, who also in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>spected
the Battalion Transport and commended it most
highly on its turn-out.</p>

<p>The III Corps, which comprised the 18th and 47th
(London) Divisions, besides the 58th, was now responsible
for the Amiens defences on the line west of Albert from
the Ancre to Aveluy Wood.</p>

<p>On the 7th May 1918 the 58th Division came from
Corps reserve into the line, and from this date until the
8th August, the beginning of the final advance, was continually
in action. The 2/4th Battalion's tours of duty
were somewhat irregular owing to the constant changes
of position which occurred during this period. The first
sector for which the Division was responsible was almost
due west of Albert, in front of the ruined village of Bouzincourt.
For a fortnight the 2/4th Battalion was in reserve
positions, either bivouacked at Molliens au Bois or Warloy
or in astonishingly bad billets in Mirvaux, and was given
a rôle as counter-attack battalion to be employed as
occasion should arise in the event of a renewed enemy
offensive. This involved constant readiness and much
reconnaissance work by officers. The last ten days of
May were spent in trenches, at first in support and afterwards
in the front system. Working parties formed the
principal item of routine, but a great deal of very valuable
patrolling work was carried out. Over the whole Corps
front No Man's Land was indeed nightly occupied by our
patrols, who were always ready for a scrap with the enemy
and endeavouring to pick up an identification. This was
partly to train up the young soldiers in the way they
should go and partly for the essential purpose of ascertaining
the enemy's intentions as to a further attack.</p>

<p>On the last night of May 2/Lieut. George took a
fighting patrol across to the enemy front line after heavy
trench mortar preparation. It was found that much
damage had been done, but though the trench was searched
for 200 yards no enemy were met and the patrol withdrew
without having suffered loss.</p>

<p>At this period the enemy was comparatively quiet,
confining his activity to shell fire in which gas shell figured
prominently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span></p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Lieut. B. Rivers Smith (recalled from six months' duty "on
exchange"); 2/Lieuts. H. G. A. Leach and J. W. George
(4th Londons); Lieut. H. C. Platts and 2/Lieut. A. L. D. Bold
(7th Londons); 2/Lieuts. A. J. N. Sievwright and J. Horsfield
(12th Londons); 2/Lieut. A. R. Armfield (20th Londons);
2/Lieuts. H. M. Bradley and W. N. M. Girling (21st Londons).
At the end of the month 2/Lieut. Sievwright rejoined his
own regiment. Drafts of N.C.O.'s and men totalled 142.</p></div>

<p>The casualties in May were comparatively light.
2/Lieut. H. M. Bradley and 1 man were killed by the
falling in of the dugout they were occupying, and in
addition 2 men were killed and 12 wounded.</p>

<p>At the beginning of June the 2/4th Battalion moved
back to Contay in Divisional reserve, and resumed its
counter-attack duties. Here a severe loss was sustained
in Lieut.-Col. W. R. H. Dann, D.S.O., who was appointed
to command the 60th Infantry Brigade with the temporary
rank of Brigadier-General. Lieut.-Col. Dann had been in
continuous command of the 2/4th Londons since November
1916, and during the Battalion's seventeen months of
active service he had held the confidence and affection of
all ranks. His great skill as a commander, his imperturbable
coolness in action, his unfailing care for the welfare
of his men, had endeared him to all, and the Battalion
said good-bye to him with genuine sorrow. The command
was taken temporarily by Major Tollworthy, but on the
8th June Major Grover, D.S.O., M.C., who had been hit
at Cachy, rejoined and assumed command with the acting
rank of Lieut.-Col.</p>

<p>On the 5th June the Battalion moved to tents and
shelters at Mirvaux, where attempts were made to carry
out a few days' training. Standing crops, which might on
no account be damaged, interfered sadly, and but little
was accomplished. The plaint of the Divisional Staff made
at the time is rather pathetic: "Training areas have not
yet been allotted. As is usually the case the hiring of
these is a very lengthy procedure, and is not likely
to be completed before the Division leaves the area."
Apparently even the full tide of the German offensive had
beat in vain against the massive structure of regulations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p>The end of May had witnessed the recrudescence of
fighting on the French front on the Chemin des Dames.
Once again the weight of the enemy's assault had overtaxed
our Allies' resources in defence, and by the 4th June
the Germans had reached their 1914 line on the Marne
at Chateau-Thierry, and were threatening Paris. It was
firmly anticipated that this fresh German success would
mean another blow against the British front at its junction
with the French, and to meet this new menace the XXII
Corps was reconstituted under Sir A. J. Godley, in G.H.Q.
reserve. To this new formation were posted the 12th,
37th and 58th Divisions, the whole of which were held in
readiness to move at two hours' notice. In accordance
with this scheme the 173rd Brigade was moved to the
Amiens area, the 2/4th Londons being billeted&mdash;this time in
comfortable quarters&mdash;at Guignemicourt on the 10th June.</p>

<p>The German attack between Montdidier and Noyon
did in fact develop, and the 37th Division was moved
southwards. The 58th Division was, however, not called
upon, and, the danger being passed, returned to the line
after a week, the 2/4th Battalion moving on the 17th June
to Molliens au Bois.</p>

<p>For the remainder of June and the whole of July
the 2/4th Battalion remained in forward areas. At first
the 173rd Brigade was in line astride the Amiens-Albert
Road and the Battalion successively occupied positions
in reserve in the La Houssoye line, in support in the
Dodo-Hill-Darling system, and in front trenches in the
Ethel-Dandy system.</p>

<p>The work on defences and the patrolling activity of
the previous month were here continued without abatement,
but with very little incident of interest. During
the last week of June the weather, which had been uniformly
good, was broken by some heavy showers, which
at once developed the extraordinary propensity of French
mud for turning into glue on the least provocation. This
hampered work on the defences but had no effect on the
spirit of the Battalion, which with careful training was
now developing once more into a well-knit and disciplined
fighting unit full of good cheer and confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 25th June Capt. F. W. Walker, D.S.O., who
had been wounded at Cachy, rejoined and resumed his
duties as Adjutant.</p>

<p>The following officers joined in June:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Lieut. A. R. Muddell (4th Londons); Lieut. G. de G. Barkas, M.C.
(to Intelligence Officer) and 2/Lieuts. T. G. Owen and S. T.
Morris (1st Londons); 2/Lieut. H. Slater (3rd Londons); Lieut.
J. D. Morrison and 2/Lieuts. G. H. Main, R. D. Cotton and
K. W. Gauld (14th Londons); 2/Lieut. F. Bidgood (16th
Londons); Lieut. C. I. Mansel-Howe (23rd Londons); and
Lieut. C. C. Brissenden (A.S.C.).</p>

<p>Reinforcements of 181 N.C.O.'s and men&mdash;mostly young soldiers&mdash;were
also received.</p></div>

<p>A few days spent in reserve at Baizieux in the first
week of July brought the 2/4th Battalion for the first
time into contact with American troops, a battalion of
whom were bivouacked here.</p>

<p>The month of July was passed in similar fashion to
those which had preceded it. From the 6th to the 18th
the Battalion was in the Ethel-Dandy system, astride the
Amiens-Albert Road, at first in front trenches and subsequently
in support. On the 18th a withdrawal to reserve
lines at Baizieux and Laviéville was effected, and here the
Battalion remained for nine days. After one day spent
in cleaning up in Behencourt the Battalion moved into
line again on the 27th July, relieving the 30th Australian
Battalion in support trenches around Ribemont, between
that village and Buire-sur-Ancre.</p>

<p>Life in the Ribemont sector was comparatively peaceful.
As before the men were principally occupied in working
parties on the defences and the officers in reconnoitring
lines of approach to the front trenches. On the whole
the enemy was quiet, though he frequently added insult
to injury by dropping on the Battalion gas shells evidently
intended for the batteries which were in action just in rear
of it. The trenches were comfortable, for all these months
of hard work had been to some purpose; and the presence
of ruined villages in the near vicinity was the means of
adding touches of home life in the shape of a few odd
sticks of broken furniture which had formerly graced
a cottage home in Buire. An inter-platoon boundary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
in one of the trenches was marked by what had once
been a handsome perambulator, while a little further on
a basket-work dressmaker's model stood sentry over a
shell hole in ludicrous isolation.</p>

<p>The ravages of the influenza epidemic of June and
July were severe, and casualties from this cause far exceeded
those inflicted by the enemy. Between the battle at
Cachy and the end of July no fewer than 427 other ranks
of the Battalion were sent to hospital, though most of
these rejoined after a week or two of absence.</p>

<p>On the 19th July the Battalion lost Lieut. S. A. Seys
(15th Londons attached), the assistant adjutant, who had
served with it since February 1917, and who left for attachment
to the staff of the 60th Brigade. An able administrator,
Seys, who, though not a 4th London officer, had
loyally made the regiment his own during his service
with it, left behind him many friends who sincerely
regretted his departure.</p>

<p>During July Lieut. A. G. Croll and drafts of 92 other
ranks joined the Battalion. 2/Lieuts. Gauld and Cotton
rejoined their own regiment. While the Battalion was
at Baizieux the medical officer, Lieut. Dunaway, U.S.
Army, was presented by the Corps Commander with the
Military Cross, awarded him for services in March and
April. It is believed that Dunaway was one of the first
American officers to receive a British decoration for
gallantry in the field.</p>

<p>At the end of July companies were commanded as
follows: A by Lieut. C. C. Brissenden, B. by Capt. A. G.
Croll, C by Capt. W. H. Parslow and D by Capt. B. Rivers
Smith.</p>

<p>All who served in the Albert sector during the summer
of 1918 will remember the Albert Road. This was very
largely used at night by incoming and outgoing troops
who used to join it somewhere in the neighbourhood of
Pont Noyelles. The journey up it was an experience
which it would indeed be hard to forget. On both sides
of the road was ranged battery after battery; it seemed
impossible that so many guns could be massed in so small
a compass. "A succession of blinding flashes alternated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
with inky blackness. The road itself was encumbered with
ammunition lorries, ration limbers and field ambulances.
Thundering detonations from the guns and a continued
grating roar from the traffic made the journey a nightmare."
So writes Croll. The picture is indeed sufficiently
disturbing. But in spite of the noisy horror a Battalion
such as the 2/4th Londons, who had made close acquaintance
with the seamy side of war in the retreat from
La Fère, could not but be heartened by the realisation that
already past losses had been made good, and that night by
night the roar of the British guns was becoming louder
and yet louder, till at last they were ready to roar
forth the barrage which was to lead our troops to final
victory.</p>

<p>The whole experience of July 1918 indeed, though
devoid of exciting incident, was such as to impress the
Battalion with the realisation that the time of waiting
was nearly at an end, and that the equilibrium, to gain
which we had been straining every nerve for three months,
was almost attained. Heavy as the German bombardments
had been from time to time, our guns with increasing
frequency demonstrated their power to silence the
enemy artillery. The results achieved by patrolling had
shown that in growing measure we were becoming masters
of No Man's Land, and encounters with enemy patrols
afforded conclusive proof of the individual prowess and
courage of our men as well as their superior morale.</p>

<p>Relieved from the trenches at Ribemont by the 1/1st
Cambridgeshire Regiment, the 2/4th Londons concentrated
at Behencourt on the evening of the 2nd August, and,
embussing at once, reached Pernois, in the Domart area,
in the early morning of the 3rd. Here it remained till
brought back to the line to take part in the great battle
of the 8th August.</p>


<h3><em>The Reserve Battalion</em></h3>

<p>In April 1918 the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion moved from
Blackdown Camp to Maida Barracks, Aldershot. The
reason for this move was primarily to provide troops for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
use in tactical schemes by students at the Senior Officers'
School, then stationed at Oudenarde Barracks.</p>

<p>While carrying out this duty the Battalion was called
upon to supply large parties daily for the School where
they were commanded by Student Officers. It cannot be
said that this duty, which fell largely on the "A IV"
platoons, was beneficial to training. The regular course
of instruction was interfered with, and a large amount of
field work was carried out before the recruits engaged in
it were sufficiently advanced to appreciate what they were
supposed to be doing. The individual training was thus
delayed and its resumption rendered proportionately difficult
when at last the attachment to the School ceased.
During the period spent at Maida the Expeditionary
Company practically ceased to exist, as all N.C.O.'s and
men who rejoined from hospital or the Command Depôt
were posted temporarily to the 1st (Reserve) Battalion,
which remained at Blackdown.</p>

<p>The German offensive of March completely revolutionised
the Reserve Battalion. The frightful losses at the
front had to be made good immediately at all costs.
Training staffs were reduced to a minimum, and every fit
officer and N.C.O. as well as every recruit, whose training
was advanced enough to lend colourable justification to it,
was at once sent overseas. The call for men did not
cease here. The General Order forbidding the despatch
of "young soldiers" overseas was, under pressure of
circumstances, revoked, and volunteers were called for
from the "A IV" boys. The response was, as may be
expected, magnificent. Under age, under-trained, these
gallant boys had but one thought&mdash;to join their overseas
battalions in the fighting line. At the end of a week the
Battalion was almost denuded of recruits under training,
while the orderly room and training staffs were on the
point of breakdown from almost continuous work and
strain.</p>

<p>Among the first to answer the call was Lieut.-Col.
Hanbury Sparrow, the Commanding Officer, who rejoined
his regiment. His place in command was taken by
Lieut.-Col. Sir Hugh Lacon, D.S.O., the Warwickshire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
Regiment, who retained the appointment till shortly
before the Armistice.</p>

<p>So reduced in numbers was the Battalion that it was
no longer useful to the Senior Officer's School, and it was
accordingly relieved by a stronger battalion and returned
to Blackdown early in August, being quartered in Frith
Hill Hutments. At the end of August the duties of second
in command were assumed by Major H. J. Duncan-Teape,
who rejoined from hospital.</p>

<p>Training was resumed on the usual routine at Frith
Hill, and at the end of August the emergency order as to
despatching "A IV" boys on draft was rescinded. The
young soldiers, therefore, reverted to the former scheme
of more gradual training. The staff was, however, busily
employed with 400 coal-miners, enlisted into the Welsh
Regiment, and sent to the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion for
training. These miners were excellent material, but their
training was not completed until the week following the
Armistice, so that they were deprived of the opportunity
of seeing active service and were rapidly demobilised.
These Welshmen were endowed in large measure with the
national gift for part-singing, and were thus enabled to
contribute materially to the social life of the Battalion.</p>

<p>During Armistice week a further reduction of Home
Cadres involved the amalgamation of the 1st and 3rd
(Reserve) Battalions, under the title of 1st (Reserve)
Battalion, so that the one reserve unit was made responsible
for supply of drafts (few of course were needed) to the
whole Fusilier Brigade. The combined unit was commanded
by Col. Vickers Dunfee, V.D., until his demobilisation
early in December, when command was given to
Lieut.-Col. A. Mather (Leinster Regiment).</p>

<p>Shortly after Christmas 1918 demobilisation began to
thin the ranks of the Battalion, while further ravages
were made by the transfer of most of the "A IV" boys
to Young Soldier Battalions, preparatory to their despatch
to join the Army of the Rhine. In February 1919 the
Battalion moved to Shoreham-by-Sea, and by the end of
the month its disbandment was completed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

THE FINAL ADVANCE</h2>


<h3>I. <em>The 2/4th Battalion in the Battles of Amiens
and Bapaume, 1918</em></h3>

<p>The middle of 1918 witnessed the veritable low watermark
of the Allied fortunes. All the protracted sledgehammer
offensives of 1916 and 1917, which had indented
the enemy's line at such ghastly cost of life, had within
a few short weeks been swept aside as if they had never
been, and the advancing tide of the Germans' offensive
had carried their eagles forward to the furthest positions
they had ever reached in 1914. In Italy the laborious
advance of our Allies towards Trieste had been turned,
when the coveted goal seemed almost within their grasp,
into a defeat which was almost decisive. Roumania had
long been utterly overrun, Austria given a new lease of
life, and Russia's debacle completed. Scarcely anywhere
was there a ray of light on this very gloomy horizon.</p>

<p>We have endeavoured to show that, bad as the situation
was, the Allies by no means accepted the crushing blows
which had been inflicted on them as decisive, and week
by week the position was gradually improving, and the
numerical superiority of the enemy was being overcome.
In July so great was the British recovery that offensive
operations on a small scale were undertaken with a view
to local improvement of our positions. Among these
the capture of Hamel and Meteren may be mentioned.</p>

<p>The bulk of the fighting, however, was on the French
front, where the enemy was endeavouring to enlarge the
salient which he had driven down to the Marne. On the
east side at Rheims and on the west in the Forêt de
Compiègne his pressure was great but weakening. The
French powers of resistance were gradually becoming more
equal to their task and the German progress corre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>spondingly
slower till at last, on the 15th July, the enemy
received a definite check. Three days later Marshal Foch
had brought forward the reserves which he had jealously
conserved through these trying days, and the enemy was
in retreat on a front of 27 miles from the Oise to the
Marne. Of the French offensive we can say nothing,
for our task lies with the British Fourth Army under
Rawlinson.</p>

<p>Immediately Marshal Foch had set his own armies in
forward motion he ordered the British and American
armies to open the offensives they had prepared. The
first object of British G.H.Q. was to disengage Amiens,
and the vast offensive movement therefore began in
Rawlinson's army, which was on the right of the British
line from its junction with the French near Moreuil to
the north of Albert.</p>

<p>In this part of the great series of victories we have to
follow the operations of the 2/4th Battalion, and we shall
deal with them in the first instance from the opening of
the offensive on August 8th until their final disbandment
on September 12th. We shall then proceed to follow the
unrolling of the battle northwards and the engagement in
it successively of the Third and First Armies, with both
of which the 1/4th Battalion fought until the Armistice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The date fixed for the great attack was 8th August,
and on that day Rawlinson's Fourth Army, comprising
from left to right the III, Australian and Canadian Corps,
would combine with Débeney's First French Army in a
supreme effort to relieve Amiens from the menace of the
Huns. With the details of the battle beyond the 58th
Division's area we are not concerned but we must, in
order to understand the rôle which the Division was
expected to play, offer some brief description of the
terrain and its effect on the Australian advance on the
right.</p>

<p>The main advance was to be made on the south bank
of the Somme by the Canadians and the Australians,
while the III Corps, including the 18th and 58th
Divisions in line, operating solely on the north bank of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
the river, would secure the left flank of the attack as far
north as Morlancourt. The establishment of this defensive
flank entailed the capture of a very strong naturally
defended position, the possession of which was vital to
the success of the troops south of the Somme.</p>

<p>The Somme, like the Oise, is a winding canalised
river running through a marshy valley. Its south bank,
though undulating, has no specially marked hill features,
but on the north the adjoining land rises to a considerable
height on the spur which traverses the narrow wedge
between the Somme and the Ancre. This plateau is
furrowed by a number of deep gullies running northward
from the river, and the sharp hills between these valleys,
falling in places by abrupt chalk cliffs to the Somme,
form very commanding features from which it would be
possible for a determined enemy to play havoc with any
attempt to advance south of the river, for they completely
dominate the south bank. The most marked of
these spurs is the long saddle immediately east of the
village of Chipilly. This feature is almost girdled by the
Somme (which makes a narrow sweep round the east,
south and west sides of it), and projects almost a mile
south of the general line of the river. It thus forms a
barrier across the ground for which the Australians would
be made responsible.</p>

<p>The capture of the Chipilly Ridge was the task allotted
to the 58th Division, while the 18th would complete the
defensive flank from the north end of the Ridge at Gressaire
Wood to Morlancourt.</p>

<p>The line of advance from the British front trenches
was full of obstacles. Immediately in front of the line,
and on the river bank was the village of Sailly Laurette,
the garrison of which, if not immediately overcome,
would be able to enfilade the whole advance as the troops
crossed No Man's Land. A mile and a half east of Sailly
Laurette lay Malard Wood, covering both slopes of one
of the declivitous gullies already alluded to; while half-way
between the Malard Wood valley and the final
objective on the cliff of Chipilly Ridge, lay a second
gully, badly enfiladed from Chipilly village and completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
overlooked from the Ridge itself. Heavy going all the
way, up hill and down dale, through features eminently
suited to machine-gun defence, culminating in a breathless
scramble up a steep slope to meet an enemy who would
probably defend it to the last; a total advance of about
two and a half miles; altogether no light task for a single
division.</p>

<p>In view of the obvious difficulty of carrying so strong
a position by frontal attack alone it was arranged that
the Australians should advance ahead of the 58th Division
and occupy the high ground near Méricourt south-east of
the Ridge, by the time the 58th was due to deliver its
final assault. By this means it was hoped to squeeze
the enemy off the Ridge in the direction of Bray without
making a fight for it, in order to avoid complete
envelopment.</p>

<p>Such was the general idea: and we must now return
to the 2/4th Battalion which we left in the preceding
chapter at Pernois on the morning of 2nd August, in
order to trace how the idea worked out.</p>

<p>The 2nd and 3rd August were spent in resting and
cleaning, and on Sunday, the 4th, after company commanders
had been admitted to the rumour that large
operations were imminent, sudden orders to move were
received. At 9.30 p.m. that night the Battalion again
embussed to La Houssoye on the Amiens-Albert Road,
whence it marched to bivouacs in a wood near Bonnay
(two miles north of Corbie, on the Ancre). Fortunately
the weather was fine and warm, for the only shelter provided
was one bell tent per company.</p>

<p>The 5th August was passed in close cover in the wood
in order that our intentions might not be revealed to
prying Bosche aeroplanes, and in the afternoon Lieut.-Col.
Grover explained the plan of attack to the company
commanders. At zero (4.20 a.m.) the 174th Brigade
would advance from Assembly line (see Map No. 17) and
dig in on the Green line 200 yards east of Malard Wood.
The 2/10th Londons (175th Brigade) were especially
attached for the capture of Sailly Laurette. The 173rd
Brigade would follow close on the 174th in artillery forma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>tion,
halt in Malard Wood for one hour and adopt attack
formation, and then passing through the Green line
would take Chipilly Ridge, Red line. The 18th Division
would advance on the left of the 58th, the 54th Brigade
going as far as the Green line, when the 53rd would leap-frog
through it to the Red line. The advance would be made
under a creeping field artillery barrage provided by ninety
18-prs. and thirty 4·5 howitzers, while the deep valleys
would be dealt with by a heavy howitzer barrage jumping
from valley to valley. Twelve tanks were to cover the
advance, two of which were allotted to the 2/10th Londons,
for Sailly Laurette, the remainder leading the 174th
Brigade to Malard Wood, where the 173rd would pick up
one per company for the final assault. The 4th Suffolks
(Pioneers) would consolidate a position slightly in rear
of the final objective.</p>

<p>The order of battle in the 173rd Brigade was: 3rd
Londons on the right, 2/4th Londons on the left, leading
battalions; 2/2nd Londons, reserve battalion. In the
2/4th Battalion the order of advance was: leading D
(Rivers Smith) on the right and C (Parslow) on the left;
supporting B (Croll) on the right, A (Brissenden) on the
left, with Battalion Headquarters in rear.</p>

<p>Another conference followed on the morning of the
6th, after which company commanders went forward to
reconnoitre the point of assembly. On arrival at the 54th
Brigade Headquarters it was found, however, that the
enemy had just delivered a sharp attack and possessed
himself of the very trenches from which we were to
"jump-off" the following morning: rather disconcerting
and possibly very serious for the whole attack, for the
Huns had reached some of the dumps and gun positions
prepared for the 8th, and it might be that they would
guess our intentions. To guard against any possibility
of failure on this score the barrage lines were completely
rearranged. Prisoners subsequently captured stated that
the British intention to attack had not been discovered,
but the extraordinary defence which the Bosche made on
8th, combined with the fact that his field guns were withdrawn
east of Gressaire Wood throws some doubt on this.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span></p>

<p>At all events the company commanders were forced to
return without seeing anything of their assembly position
or of the ground over which they were to advance, and
reported accordingly. The attack, however, could not be
postponed as the remainder of the Army and the French
also were involved, and final preparations were therefore
made for a plunge in the dark.</p>

<p>Battle surplus in charge of Capt. Hetley, who that day
returned from hospital, was sent back to Mirvaux, and at
9.30 p.m. the Battalion moved forward to a gully half a
mile north-east of Vaux-sur-Somme.</p>

<p>The 18th Division was able to re-establish its position
during the 7th, though after such losses that the 36th
Brigade (12th Division) had to be put into the attack on
the first objective in place of the 54th Brigade. The
recovery was too late for reconnaissance, which had
therefore to be limited to viewing the approaches to the
assembly, and at dusk, laden with all the usual impedimenta
of battle, the companies set out on their two and
a half mile trudge to the starting-point. The move was
made "overland," but alongside a communication trench
known as Cootamundra. The advance was not easy;
gas masks had to be worn for some distance; intermittent
shelling caused delays; tanks now and then drifted
through the columns, breaking them up; and as usual
shell holes in the dark proved a fruitful source of annoyance;
but with all these drawbacks it was a cheerful and
optimistic, if blasphemous, Battalion that arrived in the
front line well up to time.</p>

<p>Dawn broke at last and the company commanders,
eagerly expecting to see the positions which they had
never yet viewed, were dismayed to find the sun rising
on a dense fog which enshrouded the whole landscape
and limited vision to about 20 yards! However, there
was nothing for it but to get up and try to keep touch with
the assaulting troops. The enemy's barrage came down
quickly and heavily, and the companies moved forward
rapidly over No Man's Land, though a good many fell.
By bad luck most of the Battalion Headquarters, including
Lieut.-Col. Grover and Capt. Walker the Adjutant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
both severely hit, were knocked out within a few minutes,
and this misfortune dogged the Battalion through the day.
Moving forward slowly, trusting to a compass bearing to
bring them to the north edge of Malard Wood, the companies
pushed on, our barrage roaring on far ahead and
no troops in sight right or left of them.</p>

<p>Adverse comments have been made on the Division
for a serious loss of direction this day. As a matter of
fact it was not so serious as has been stated by some
writers, but it is true that the 2/4th Battalion at first
drifted about 500 yards over its left boundary into the
18th Division territory. This divergence was also followed
by the 2/2nd Londons, who encroached on what should
properly have been our right company front. This is
regrettable, but comprehensible if a close study be made
of a contoured map. The gullies which had to be crossed
ran obliquely across the line of advance. If anyone
cares to try hill climbing in a fog he will realise the
extreme difficulty of maintaining a sidelong direction.</p>

<p>Another cause of divergence from the correct direction
lay in the numerous small pockets of enemy who had to
be mopped up by the companies on route. These small
parties offered comparatively little opposition, but they
necessitated a cautious advance. Moreover, as they were
not all in the exact path of the advancing platoons, it
was inevitable to make a deliberate deflection to deal
with them, after which the idea of direction in the fog
became still more nebulous.</p>

<p>After some time Croll and Parslow, whose companies
were in touch, reached a trench lately occupied by the
enemy, badly smashed and full of dead Huns. Here a
parley was held, and they decided that they were off the
line. The advance was resumed in a south-easterly
direction, extended order being used owing to the very
severe machine-gun fire at this point. Parslow, having
received news of the Colonel's casualty, assumed command.
During this second advance the enemy's fire began to
slacken and the mist showed some signs of lifting. After
about 200 yards these companies found one of the tanks
which was due to meet them at Malard Wood roaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
about disconsolately, having completely lost its bearings,
but this was put on the right track and began to follow
the companies, though it soon vanished again in the mist:
a passing ship!</p>

<p>At about 8.30 the mist began to thin rapidly and B
and C Companies reached the hedge at the north end of
Malard Wood, where they gained touch with Rivers
Smith (D Company), and Parslow pushed out to the right
to link up with Brissenden (A Company), who had gained
the west edge of the Wood. The 174th Brigade were still
in the Wood and had not yet reached the Green line,
and the lifting mist disclosed no troops east of it. A
company of 8th Royal Berkshires (53rd Brigade) were
strung out in a north-easterly direction on the left of the
Battalion, while immediately in front was the head of
the Malard Wood Gully, about 40 yards wide, and
beyond it a cornfield breast high with crops which
stretched as far as Gressaire Wood. Sharp bursts of
machine-gun fire from Malard Wood and shrapnel bursts
from Gressaire Wood took a steady toll of our men and
rendered further advance without artillery support impossible.
But our artillery had carried its barrage forward
to the final objective, believing that the infantry were
following it, and was now silent.</p>

<p>At about 9.30 a.m. the Berkshires informed Croll, who
had taken charge of the left half of the Battalion, that they
were going to attack Gressaire Wood, and asking the
2/4th Battalion to advance with them. Croll immediately
sent runners to Parslow and Brissenden in the Wood
warning them of this intention; and, swinging half right
to conform to the Berkshires, the advance began, but was
brought to a standstill on the east edge of the gully by
parties of the enemy working forward with machine-guns
from Gressaire Wood.</p>

<p>Further advance was out of the question, and leaving
three Lewis gun posts east of the gully, Croll withdrew
his troops to the hedge previously occupied; there the
Battalion began to dig in. After a conference of the few
remaining officers it was decided to send 2/Lieut. E. P.
Higgs back to Brigade to explain the position and ask for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
fresh orders and for artillery support to a further advance.
Almost immediately after this parley broke up poor
Rivers Smith was killed by a piece of shell which hit him
in the neck. In the meantime, runners sent out to the
right flank returned with the information that the 2/4th
and 3rd Battalions were mixed up in Malard Wood, that
the 2/2nd had come up and that Lieut.-Col. Miller of the
2/2nd was reorganising the troops.</p>

<p>A gap of 300 yards between the two halves of the
Battalion had occurred in the last attempt to get forward,
and the position at noon was that Brissenden (Parslow
had been hit) was in charge of the right half Battalion
on the east edge of Malard Wood, and Croll with the
left half lined along the hedge north of the Wood. The
Wood was now completely cleared of enemy, but egress
from the east edge of it was impossible. Barkas (Intelligence
Officer) now came forward from Headquarters
to take over command, being cognisant of the position
on the right and acquainted with the H.Q. Staffs of the
other Battalions. He agreed with Croll that further
attempts to push forward were useless without further
support. Col. Urquart (L.T.M. Battery) was reported
on his way up to take over from Barkas.</p>

<p>While this was happening the barrage had, as already
stated, moved forward from the Green line at the
scheduled hour on to Chipilly Ridge, but owing to the loss
of direction only a few small parties were available to
follow it and of these probably none reached the Ridge.
The Huns on the Ridge were holding up by machine-gun
fire the Australians on the south of the river, and they
failed to reach the high ground from which the position
was to be outflanked. Unfortunately aerial reports to
Divisional Headquarters persisted that the Ridge was in
our hands, and this mistake led to serious casualties in
the afternoon. The 2/2nd Londons were ordered to
advance at 3 p.m., but owing to the false report artillery
support was refused them. In these circumstances the
attack, though pushed forward by the 2/2nd with great
gallantry, was inevitably withered by enemy machine-gun
fire from Gressaire Wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span></p>

<p>No further move was attempted that day. At about
4 p.m. Major Sutcliffe of the 2/2nd took over the 2/4th
Battalion&mdash;the fifth C.O. within twelve hours!&mdash;and
the positions already occupied were consolidated, Lewis
gun posts being pushed forward across the gully. The
night positions of the Battalion are shown on the
map.</p>

<p>South of the Somme the day had been&mdash;except in the
area next the river swept from Chipilly Ridge&mdash;one of
immense success, an advance of about seven miles being
made by the Canadians. On the left of the 58th Division
the 12th had reached the Green line but had been unable
to progress beyond it.</p>

<p>An immediate resumption of the attack to reduce the
Chipilly stronghold and so remove the one remaining
obstacle to an important advance was obviously necessary,
but in view of the restricted success on the previous
day a modification of the original intention was
essential.</p>

<p>The main object of the attack of the 9th August
was to gain the line Bray-sur-Somme&mdash;Dernancourt. To
ensure that the assault should have sufficient weight to
carry it through successfully, and in view of the serious
losses of the Division on the previous day, the 133rd
American Regiment (Col. Samborn) then in Army reserve
some miles in rear was attached for the operation. The
main attack on the Divisional front was to be carried out
by the 175th Brigade on the left and the Americans on
the right; while in conjunction with it the capture of
Chipilly and the Ridge was to be entrusted to the 174th
and 173rd Brigades.</p>

<p>The distance which the Americans had to advance to
reach their starting line necessarily caused a postponement
of the operation till late in the afternoon, the earlier
hours of the day being employed in side-stepping the
173rd Brigade to face its new objective, and to leave
room for the Americans to come into line.</p>

<p>At 6 a.m. Major Sutcliffe issued orders to the Battalion
to reorganise and prepare for a further advance, and
these orders were followed later, as a result of reports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
received by aerial reconnaissance, by instructions to
push forward fighting patrols to ascertain whether
Gressaire Wood were still occupied. The sharp machine-gun
fire with which these patrols were met left no room
for doubt as to the situation. Brigade received orders
for the afternoon attack at 1 p.m., but owing to the lack
of telephone communication it was two hours later when
Lieut.-Col. Miller, who was in charge of the whole of the
advanced troops, sent for Croll. The grim humour of
the situation was succinctly summed up in Lieut.-Col.
Miller's greeting. "Hullo, Croll, aren't you dead yet?"
"No sir!" replied Croll. "Then you damned soon will
be!" And orders for the attack were issued: "You will
withdraw all patrols and posts at once, move your men
under cover of Malard Wood and take up a position as
soon as possible in a line of trenches extending for about
400 yards southward from the Quarry. Lieut. Brissenden
has similar orders. You will occupy this position and be
prepared to advance at 5.30 and capture the original
objective, Chipilly Ridge. You will advance in two
waves, Brissenden with his half Battalion in the first
wave, and you with the remainder of the Battalion in
the second wave. The position must be taken at all
costs."</p>

<p>This assembly position south of the Quarry was that
occupied by the 9th Londons on the previous night,
but on arrival it was found to be only a line of shell holes.
The 173rd Brigade was to attack with the 3rd Londons
on the right, the 2/4th in the centre and the 2/2nd on the
left, with the 2/10th attached in reserve. The assembly
proceeded as rapidly as possible, though time was short
and the barrage could not open until all patrols were in.
The Americans, who were rushed up from the rear, had
to double nearly a mile to reach their assembly position
at Malard Wood, but by a few minutes after zero every
unit was moving forward. The side-step of the 2/4th
Battalion was carried out under very heavy machine-gun
fire from Celestin Wood, the enemy having doubtless seen
the movement, and delay was caused by searching for the
trench (non-existent) which had been fixed as the start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
line. Our barrage opened well up to time but the shells
fell harmlessly in Chipilly Valley instead of on the Ridge,
which again became a hornet's nest of Hun machine-gunners.</p>

<p>Under this heavy fire the Battalion began the advance,
much harassed also from Celestin Wood on their right
flank. Brissenden was seriously hit early, and Mansel-Howe
(B Company) killed. Croll took over the whole
remnants of the Battalion and pushed forward, the men
behaving with magnificent coolness and advancing by
rushes. Every party which rushed forward, however,
lost men, and Croll himself was hit in the knee though he
bravely struggled on in the endeavour to get his men
into some sort of cover. The Americans on the left were
not yet up in line, and the fire from the right flank continued.
Casualties were now so numerous that it was
clear the Battalion could never reach the Ridge in anything
approaching assaulting strength, and Croll decided
to dig in in the shelter of the Chipilly gully, sending back
a runner to Lieut.-Col. Miller with a report of the situation.
In this position the Battalion was badly enfiladed from
Chipilly village, and to make matters worse groups of
Bosche could be seen running down from the crest of
the Ridge, evidently in preparation for a counter-attack.
This attack, however, was never delivered, for a change
of the situation, almost miraculous in its suddenness,
occurred. On the right the 2/10th Londons had been
fighting stubbornly, and before dark managed to clear
Chipilly village and began to work up the south end of
the Ridge. Here they were held up by a nest of Bosche
machine-gunners firing southwards from the head of
Chipilly Valley, but the Americans, advancing on the left
with magnificent dash towards Gressaire Wood, mopped
up this position. A glance at the map will show the
result. Further tenure of the Ridge was impossible for
the Bosche, who promptly retreated to avoid being caught
by the pincers which were closing on them.</p>

<p>By 11 p.m. the Brigade was firmly established on the
Ridge, while the main operation had proved completely
successful.</p>

<p>For his excellent work in this action Capt. A. G. Croll
was awarded the M.C.</p>

<p>The experience of these two days' fighting had demonstrated
clearly that the River Somme was an unsatisfactory
boundary between the III and Australian
Corps. The hill slopes on each bank formed tactical
features so inter-supporting that it was deemed essential
to bring both banks into the area of one command; and
accordingly on the 10th August the Australian Corps took
over with the 3rd Australian Division a sector immediately
adjacent to the north bank. This redistribution involved
a shortening of the 58th Divisional sector, and the 173rd
Brigade, handing over its line to the Australians at about
2 p.m., withdrew to the reserve area, the 2/4th Londons
concentrating in bivouacs near Bonnay.</p>

<p>During the 10th an enemy counter-attack set back
slightly the positions gained by us the preceding day, but
the situation was soon re-established and strong patrols
pushed forward by the Division brought them to the line
of the outer Amiens defences.</p>

<p>The following day the III Corps was taken over
temporarily by Sir A. J. Godley.</p>

<p>This practically brought to a close the first phase of
the Fourth Army's great advance, which is officially
known as the Battle of Amiens, 1918. Amiens, for so
long threatened by a victorious enemy, was now liberated,
and, important as was this result of the three days' struggle,
other results accruing from the battle were still more vital.
The actual loss inflicted on the Huns&mdash;upwards of 23,000
prisoners and 400 guns were captured&mdash;were in themselves
a matter of great moment; but the captures themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
showed that already the Germans were flinging their
reserves into the fight. This undoubtedly had the effect
of paving the way for the successful French advance which
began south of Montdidier on the 10th August. Perhaps
the most cheering moral of all was the establishment of
the fact that three anxious months of constant strain,
following on a retreat of unprecedented rapidity and loss,
had left the fighting qualities of our troops unimpaired&mdash;perhaps
to the surprise of some gloomy folks at home&mdash;while
evidence was already abundant that the enemy was
not standing to it as he had done in former British offensives.
His morale was beginning to crack. This is evidenced by
actual numbers: 13 British divisions and 3 cavalry
divisions had defeated 20 German divisions and secured
an advance of 12 miles in 5 days' fighting. To enable us
to judge of the enormous effect of this great victory we
have the evidence of Ludendorff himself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Emperor told me that after the failure of the
July offensive and after the 8th August, he knew the
war could no longer be won."</p></div>

<p>A good deal of severe criticism has been levelled at the
III Corps in general, and at the 58th Division in particular,
for the lack of success attained on the first day of battle.
It is undoubtedly a fact that the failure to eject the Bosche
from Chipilly Ridge on the 8th August caused the infliction
of severe loss on our Australian neighbours on the
right flank. We do not pose as apologists for the Division
or for the 2/4th Londons, and are satisfied that no excuses
for them are needed. But we feel justified, in view of what
has been said, in pointing to certain circumstances of the
battle as contributing towards the restriction of their
success. We propose not to argue these circumstances
but merely to state them:</p>

<p>1. The enemy attack on the 18th Division on the 6th
August not only deprived our company commanders of
any opportunity of reconnoitring their ground, but also
entirely disposed of the surprise effect gained south of the
Somme, for undoubtedly the Bosche expected a counter-attack

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The mist of 8th August, which made success depend
largely on a correct compass march over unseen and shell-torn
ground.</p>

<p>3. The fact that no tanks arrived on the Green line to
lead the Battalion forward to the second objective, whereby
the enemy machine-gun defence was not impeded. We
do not wish to pass the blame on to the tanks; their
difficulties in reaching the start-line were as acute as our
own, and the ground much more difficult for them than
it was south of the river.</p>

<p>4. The startling rapidity with which the Battalion
command changed during the battle.</p>

<p>These are not excuses for failure. We are prepared to
leave to the judgment of impartial critics the decision as
to whether the Battalion, and the Division as a whole, did
all in its power to perform its duty. That the operations
of the Division during these two days' fighting were not
altogether unfruitful is evidenced by the fact that their
total captures amounted to 1925 prisoners, 68 guns, 190
machine-guns and 36 trench mortars, while the whole
area of advance was littered with enemy dead.</p>

<p>A lull in the active operations now occurred while
heavy batteries, dumps and all necessary material were
advanced in preparation for the next phase of the struggle,
which would involve the ejection of the Hun from a
strongly defended system of trenches.</p>

<p>After a night's rest the Battalion marched on the
11th August to a wood at Heilly (near Ribemont),
where it was joined by the first line transport and the
battle surplus, returning on the afternoon of the 13th
to Pont Noyelles. Here it was accommodated in billets,
the most comfortable quarters since the few days at
Guignemicourt.</p>

<p>A few days' rest at Pont Noyelles, now some eleven
miles in rear of the battle line, were devoted to reorganisation
and to assimilation of several reinforcements of
officers, N.C.O.'s and men. On his return from short leave
on the 14th August Major Tollworthy assumed temporary
command of the Battalion, but a week later Major W.
McC. Crosbie, M.C., Royal Munster Fusiliers, arrived and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
took over the command. The adjutancy of the Battalion
was taken over by Lieut. H. J. King, M.C.</p>

<p>During this period the Battalion was inspected successively
by the Brigadier and by the Corps Commander, who
saw the troops at training.</p>

<p>The reinforcements received between the 10th and
22nd August were:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>2/Lieuts. R. E. Glover, L. A. Still, W. J. Till and F. J. Paterson
(4th Londons);</p></div>

<p>and officers of other units attached as follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>2/Lieuts. C. C. W. Goodale, L. A. Palmer and A. W. Tucker
(1st Londons);</p>

<p>2/Lieuts. P. F. Royce, W. C. B. Hall and T. R. A. Maynard
(2nd Londons);</p>

<p>2/Lieuts. J. C. Wood and H. Irvine (3rd Londons);</p>

<p>2/Lieuts. G. Gilson, H. Lelyveld, J. Slattery, M. F. Giles and
H. B. Bartleet (5th Londons);</p>

<p>2/Lieuts. J. T. Spencer and E. S. McKittrick (8th Londons);</p>

<p>2/Lieut. W. A. Davies (9th Londons);</p>

<p>and 480 N.C.O.'s and men.</p></div>

<p>The majority of this large reinforcement consisted of
men from the 14th Division, which had suffered very
severely in the battles of March 1918. The drafts of
young soldiers on which the Battalion had been depending
of late, though of excellent material, were obviously not
so desirable as fully seasoned soldiers; and the 14th
Division men were therefore particularly welcome. With
a seasoning of old 2/4th London men and the remnants
of the K.O.Y.L.I., who had come from the 16th Entrenching
Battalion, they helped to make up once again a really fine
Battalion.</p>

<p>On the 21st August the offensive was resumed and
though, as we have stated, we propose to continue the
record of the 2/4th Battalion's operations in the Fourth
Army, it should be borne in mind that henceforth the Army
instead of having an inert neighbour on its left flank had
an active one in the Third Army, which was now also on
the move.</p>

<p>This new great battle (21st August to 1st September),
known as the Battle of Bapaume, 1918, extended the area
of fighting to the Somme-Scarpe salient.</p>

<p>The increasing enemy resistance at the termination of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
the Battle of Amiens had drawn G.H.Q. to the decision to
break off the battle and transfer their attention to another
part of the front; a method which throughout the closing
period of the war proved its value. The Germans were
kept always in doubt&mdash;as the British had been in March
1918&mdash;as to whether each fresh offensive was in reality
only a feint, in doubt as to where to place their already
dwindling reserves. Moreover, the British Armies were
now no longer faced by line upon line of almost impregnable
trenches as they had been in 1916, and frontal attacks
were not the only possibility open to them.</p>

<p>G.H.Q. therefore decided on a vast turning movement.
An attack in a south-easterly direction between Albert
and Arras would turn the flank of the Somme line of
defence about Péronne, and would constitute a distinct
forward step towards the further objectives of Cambrai
and St Quentin.</p>

<p>The immediate object of the III Corps was to free
Albert and to oust the Bosche from the strong defensive
system which he had built up round the town during the
summer months. On the first day of the III Corps battle,
22nd August, the 58th Division was in Corps reserve, the
divisions in line being from right to left, the 47th, 12th
and 18th.</p>

<p>The 2/4th Battalion remained at training on the 22nd
August, but an early move was made the following morning,
when it marched at 4 a.m. to a sheltered valley half a mile
south of Méricourt-l'Abbé. In this position it remained
all day together with the rest of the Brigade; the 174th
Brigade being in the old British line at Morlancourt, at
the disposal of the 18th Division. In the centre the 47th
Division carried the line forward to the high ground east
of the Happy Valley, while on the right the Australians
occupied the high ground immediately north of Bray.</p>

<p>The exploitation of this success was ordered by Army
H.Q. for the following day, but the situation was altered
by a strong German counter-attack, which late in the
afternoon drove the 142nd Brigade (47th Division) almost
back to their start-line, leaving the Australians at Bray in
an awkward salient. That night the 175th Brigade moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
from its reserve area near Tailles Wood and took over the
line from the 142nd. The following day was occupied in
reorganisation, though the advance was continued south
of the river, and orders were received for the pressure to
be continued on the whole army front on the 24th August.</p>

<p>At 1 a.m. that morning the attack was prosecuted by
the 47th Division, in conjunction with the 3rd Australians
on the right and the 12th on the left. The 47th Division
attack was carried out by the 175th (attached) and
140th Brigades, the battalions of the 173rd Brigade being
ordered to support the 175th. For this purpose the 2/4th
Battalion was turned out at midnight on the 23rd/24th
August and reached a position of assembly in the old
Amiens defence line east of Morlancourt at 4 a.m. on the
24th. The attack was entirely successful. The Happy
Valley once more passed into our hands, and the 47th
Division established itself finally on the farther crest.
The Australians occupied Bray, while on the left the 12th
Division pressed forward in the direction of Fricourt.
The enemy opposition was not severe though between
3 a.m. and 8 a.m. a large amount of high explosive and
gas shelling was experienced. The day brought forth
further evidence of the increasing demoralisation of the
enemy troops, and intelligence reports pointing strongly
to the probability that the enemy was fighting a delaying
action preparatory to a big retreat, the immediate exploitation
of the success was ordered.</p>

<p>This day the 175th Brigade remained in line but came
once more under orders of the 58th Division which took
over the Divisional sector, the 174th Brigade going into
line on the right of the 175th.</p>

<p>During the morning a conference of commanding
officers in the 173rd Brigade was held and orders were
issued for the further advance. The attack was to be
made with two brigades in line, the 175th on the right and
the 140th on the left, supported by the 173rd Brigade.
This latter was to be led by the 2/2nd and 3rd Londons
with the 2/4th Londons in support, the last-named with
the rôle of being prepared to support any part of the front
and carry it on to the final objective. Owing, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
to the situation remaining obscure on the left flank this
operation was postponed till 2.30 a.m. on the 25th, when
rapid developments took place.</p>

<p>In accordance with the orders already issued the 2/4th
Londons moved from their Assembly position near Tailles
Wood, the order of march being A, B, C, D Companies
with Headquarters and one section Brigade Machine-Gun
Company bringing up the rear, and with 100 yard intervals
between companies. In this order it reached a position
in the Happy Valley under cover of a dense mist at 4 a.m.
on the 25th August. Here it was to stand fast awaiting
further orders from the Brigadier.</p>

<p>But in the meantime the Division, evidently still
bearing in mind the experience of February 1917, had
issued instructions to the effect that should the leading
battalions lose touch with the enemy an advanced guard
should at once be formed to push forward rapidly and regain
contact. This was the contingency which materialised.</p>

<p>At 6.30 a.m. the attacking units reported themselves
on their objectives, but in the mist touch with the enemy
seemed to be lost, and all units of the 173rd Brigade were
ordered to advance. The Brigadier at once issued orders
for the formation of the advanced guard, and the 2/4th
Battalion, which was more or less definitely located in
the Happy Valley and was thus the battalion most easily
to be reached in the mist, was selected for this duty.</p>

<p>The advanced guard troops were:</p>

<div class="center">
<ul>
  <li>No. 2 Troop Northumberland Hussars,</li>
  <li>2/4th Londons,</li>
  <li>1 Section 86th Brigade R.F.A.,</li>
  <li>1 Section M.G.C.,</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>the whole under Major Crosbie.</p>

<p>The line of advance ordered was cross-country as far
as Bronfay Farm and thence along the Bray-Maricourt
Road. The Battalion was to advance in column of route
until ordered to deploy. At 8.30 a.m. the guard was
formed and the advance began, A Company under Lieut.
V. C. Prince forming the Vanguard with Headquarters,
B, C and D Companies following as Main Guard. This
was an entirely new role for the 2/4th Battalion, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
sudden development of open warfare conditions, the
realisation that the Battalion was in close formation on a
road with cavalry operating ahead and the guns following,
raised everyone's hopes and expectations to the highest
pitch. The move was of course made without artillery
support, and until Bronfay Farm was nearly reached very
little sign of his existence was vouchsafed by the Bosche,
beyond a little desultory shell-fire.</p>

<p>About this time the mist dispersed and the cavalry
were checked by severe machine-gun fire from Billon Wood
and the high ground to the north of it. The company
commanders showed great initiative and dash, and a
valuable reconnaissance was made by 2/Lieut. Prince and
Cooke, his Sergt.-Major, to ascertain where the bulk of
the firing was coming from. Quickly grasping the situation,
Prince deployed his company and led it against the
south-west edge of the Wood. The rear companies deploying
in turn, the whole Battalion became committed
to the attack, which, owing to the conditions under which
it started, developed a little raggedly as regards the
frontages occupied by companies, but still with good
discipline and plenty of dash. Hetley (B Company) made
for the left or north edge of the Wood along the Maricourt
Road, while the gap between him and Prince was promptly
taken up by C and D Companies. Observing the action
taken by the 2/4th Londons, Brigade promptly pushed
forward the 2/2nd Londons to the left flank to deal with
the high ground north of Billon Wood, and ordered the
3rd Londons to support the attack.</p>

<p>The enemy shelling had now assumed very severe
proportions, and though little resistance was met with
by the 2/4th Battalion in Billon Wood, which it cleared
without much difficulty, the Bosche gunners were able
effectually to prevent it from emerging from the east
edge of the Wood. Hetley says about this bombardment,
"The shelling of Billon Wood was one of the heaviest I
have ever undergone, being quite comparable to Bullecourt
or the Salient in 1917." The line in the Wood was
rather patchy and Hetley, leaving Grimsdell in charge,
returned to Battalion Headquarters where Major Crosbie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
provided him with a couple of Lewis guns and about
twenty-five men. With these he returned, and having got
the Battalion into a deep trench, put out observation posts
on the east edge of the Wood. The Battalion is credited
by Division with having gained a line this day some 200
yards east of the Wood, but it seems doubtful whether
this conclusion can be supported.</p>

<p>On the left flank, however, the 2/2nd and 3rd Londons
made a good deal of progress up the long spur leading
to Maricourt, and at the end of the day had established
themselves in a chain of small copses about 500 yards
west of the village. Their further progress was here
arrested, owing to the fact that the 12th Division on the
left was held up before Carnoy, which remained for the
time in the enemy's hands.</p>

<p>At midnight the 2/4th Battalion was relieved by the
7th Londons of the 174th Brigade, which side-stepped
to the left, and on relief was concentrated at Great Bear
Wood north-east of the Happy Valley.</p>

<p>The casualties of the day, due almost entirely to
shell-fire, were:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>2/Lieuts. H. Lelyveld, J. C. Wood, A. Irvine and C. C. W. Goodale,
wounded, and in N.C.O.'s and men 15 killed, 166 wounded
and 14 missing.</p></div>

<p>The good work of 2/Lieut. Prince and C.S.M. Cooke
has already been referred to. Prince was rewarded with
the M.C. Cooke was killed in the Wood, and a few
days after his death notification was received that he had
been awarded the M.C. for his work on the 8th August.
Mention must also be made of Pte. Campion, a battalion
runner, who performed invaluable work in locating the
scattered parties of the Battalion in the Wood, thereby
enabling Hetley to assume proper control of the firing line.</p>

<p>On the 26th August the following congratulatory
message was issued by the Brigadier (Brig.-Gen. Charles
Corkoran):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Major-General commanding the Division in congratulating
you all wishes me to tell you that Sir Douglas
Haig, the Army Commander and the Corps Commander
have all expressed the highest praise for the way in which
the Brigade is fighting. For myself I cannot say how
proud I am to be in command of such a brigade as the
Fusilier Brigade."</p></div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span></p>

<p>Orders were issued on the night of the 25th/26th
August for the prosecution of the attack on the following
day, but the 26th proved a day of check. The 3rd
Londons, who led the attack, reached Maricourt, but,
the flanking brigades being held up, they were unsupported
and had to fall back. A threatened German counter-attack
south of Maricourt having failed to materialise,
the remainder of the day was occupied in consolidation
on a line about 500 yards west of the village.</p>

<p>The 2/4th Battalion was moved from Great Bear Wood
at 9 a.m. on the 26th in anticipation of a successful attack,
and took up a position in considerable depth in the
vicinity of Bronfay Farm, where it was occupied in preparations
for the battle of the 27th August. This day the
Battalion was joined by Lieut. H. P. Lawrence and 2/Lieut.
R. Grey, attached from the 10th Londons, and two days
later by 2/Lieuts. H. H. Gant (2nd Londons), H. Hearnshaw
(7th Londons) and C Brandram (9th Londons).</p>

<p>The objectives of the projected attack of the 27th
August were the capture of Maricourt and the establishment
of our line in the old British trenches of July 1916 on
the eastern fringe of Maricourt Wood, east of the village.
Exploitation of the success into the old German trenches
as opportunity should allow was also arranged for. The
leading battalion of the Brigade was the 3rd Londons, with
the 2/4th Londons in close support and the 2/2nd Londons
in reserve. Simultaneous attacks were to be made by the
3rd Australians in the direction of Vaux on the right and
by the 12th Division towards Maltzhorn Farm on the left.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the 2/4th Battalion was assembled
in artillery formation on the line consolidated the previous
day, and twenty minutes after zero (4.55 a.m.) it followed
the 3rd Londons towards Maricourt. The greater part
of the advance was through the village itself and the
Battalion soon got rather mixed up with the 3rd Londons
in the course of mopping up the numerous dugouts in
its ruins. The defence put up by the Germans, at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
on the 2/4th Battalion's front, this day showed marked
deterioration. It was sporadic and on the whole poor,
and with comparatively little difficulty and remarkably
small loss to itself, the Battalion gained its final objective
east of the Wood, a message from Capt. Hetley to this
effect being received in Battalion Headquarters at 7.30 a.m.</p>

<p>The inevitable breaking up of attack formations consequent
on passing through a ruined village resulted in
a good deal of disorganisation, and on arrival on the
objective, which the 2/4th Battalion reached on the
extreme left of the Brigade sector, no touch was found
with either the 3rd Londons on the right or the 12th
Division on the left. Hetley, however, who again assumed
control on the spot, soon set this to rights, and leaving
C.S.M. Bonser, D.C.M., to reorganise the platoons immediately
available, sent C.S.M. Cowland to pick up the
12th Division on the left, while he himself pushed out to
the right flank with a patrol. These efforts were entirely
successful, and both the neighbouring battalions being found
to be well up and the flanks thus secured, Hetley returned
and established his headquarters in the railway cutting.</p>

<p>The rapidity of this advance and the completeness of
its success leave one breathless after the weary and
sanguinary struggles with which this ground had been
hardly wrung from the enemy's grip in 1916. Maricourt
Wood was full of German dugouts, and evidently these
had not been quite completely dealt with during the
advance, for later in the morning a couple of German
gentlemen, feeling a desire to take the morning air, came
quietly strolling down the hill from the Wood to Hetley's
headquarters, where his unexpected presence caused them
painful surprise.</p>

<p>During the morning C.S.M. Bonser was entrusted with
the task of collecting isolated groups of men and with
them filling up gaps and forming a support line in case
of counter-attack. At this work he proved invaluable.
Hetley writes: "He led party after party round dugouts
in Maricourt clearing out Bosche, and was later perfectly
splendid in organising the men and fetching up reinforcements,
that is, rallying isolated parties in the town and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
Wood, all this under heavy if somewhat wild shell fire."
Bonser received a bar to his D.C.M. for this day's work,
and later, after the disbandment of the Battalion, when
attached to the 2/2nd Londons gained a second bar on
September 18th at Epéhy.</p>

<p>On our flanks the day was equally successful, Vaux
falling to the Australians, and the high ground at Maltzhorn
Farm passing into the 12th Division's hands. No counter-attack
was delivered by the Bosche and we were left in
undisputed possession of our gains which amounted to
some 1700 yards of ground. Orders were issued during
the day that the advance should be pressed on to Maurepas
Station, but these were subsequently cancelled, as the
enemy were found to be holding their old 1916 line in
strength with three fresh divisions.</p>

<p>At 8 p.m. Major Crosbie made a reconnaissance of the
line and organised the Battalion in two companies; A and
B being placed under Capt. Hetley and C and D under
2/Lieut. Grimsdell, the Battalion's right flank resting on
the point at which the railway crossed the front trench.
Throughout the night the position was heavily shelled,
but with very little loss to us.</p>

<p>In spite of the fatigue of the troops Army H.Q. was
fixed in its determination to allow the Bosche no breathing
space, and at 1 a.m. 28th August orders were received
in the line that the attack was to be continued that
day. The 3rd Londons were to lead the Brigade again,
while the 2/2nd and 2/4th Londons were to remain
in reserve in the old British front line. At 4.45 a.m.
the attack was launched. The day resolved itself into
a series of patrol encounters, in the course of which some
very stubborn opposition was met with, notably in the
Bois d'en Haut. By the evening the Divisional line had
been established another 1000 yards further east, in front
of the Bois d'en Haut and in touch on the left with the
12th Division, who had taken Hardecourt after stiff
resistance, while the Australians had possessed themselves
of Curlu.</p>

<p>That evening the Battalion was relieved, the 175th
Brigade taking over the sector, and withdrew to reserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
in a valley north of Bray-sur-Somme, a few hundred
yards from the site of the old Citadel Camp, a spot well
known to the Somme veterans of the 1/4th Battalion.</p>

<p>During the whole of these days in fact the 2/4th
Battalion, though a little distance south of the Guillemont
heights, had been crossing the tracks of the 1/4th
Battalion in the earlier battles of this historic district,
but under what extraordinarily different conditions! The
painful steps of 1916, which gained perhaps a few hundred
yards a week at appalling cost of life, amid the wretchedness
of mud and rain, were now victorious strides which
had carried our lines forward like an irresistible tide.
Since the 2/4th Battalion had moved into the Happy
Valley on the 24th August it had advanced some 8000
yards and already half the devastation of the old Somme
battlefields was left behind.</p>

<p>The losses of the two days' fighting at Maricourt were,
considering the extent of the gains, remarkably light.
Lieut A. R. Muddell and 2/Lieuts. E. C. McKittrick and
R. Grey were wounded, while Lieut. and Adjt. H. J. King,
M.C., and Lieut. H. P. Lawrence were also hit but remained
at duty. 114 N.C.O.'s and men became casualties,
9 being killed, 74 wounded and 29 missing.</p>

<p>For their splendid leadership Capt. G. H. Hetley and
2/Lieut. E. V. Grimsdell were rewarded with the M.C.</p>

<p>After the 173rd Brigade came out of the line the
58th Division remained in action and on the 29th August
it carried the line forward, against an ever-increasing
opposition, to the east of Maurepas. The following day,
the 47th Division having taken over from the 12th on our
left, the two divisions of Londoners again pressed on
shoulder to shoulder. The enemy resistance this day was
as stubborn as had been experienced for some time and
the advance was eventually checked with the 58th facing
the west edge of Marrières Wood, and the 47th extending
the line to Priez Farm.</p>

<p>The 29th August was occupied by the 2/4th Battalion
in cleaning and resting, and the necessary reorganisation
consequent on its losses in the battle were effected. This
day Major Crosbie left to take charge of the Battle Surplus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
Camp and Major F. G. Tollworthy, M.C., once more
assumed command of the Battalion. On the 30th August
Lieut. A. B. Carpenter (25th Londons) with 29 other ranks
joined the Battalion.</p>

<p>The Fourth Army Line was now approaching Péronne,
and from Cléry to St Christ the Australian Corps had
reached the west bank of the Somme. The stiffening
of the enemy resistance which had been so noticeable
during the last two days' fighting, and the natural strength
of the Somme as an obstacle, made it clear that the enemy
was determined to hold out at Péronne as long as possible;
and true to its scheme of allowing the Hun no respite,
the Army at once made its plans for forcing a bridgehead
over the river, with the object of reducing Péronne and
the Somme line of defence.</p>

<p>The most favourable point of attack appeared to be
the river between Péronne and Cléry, and the capture
of the eminence of Mont St Quentin, though likely to
be arduous, would give us complete command of Péronne
itself and enable us to enfilade the whole of the enemy
positions south of the city on the east of the river. The
actual capture of Mont St Quentin was entrusted to
the Australians in whose path it lay, and the movements
of the III Corps to their north formed a part of the scheme
for widening the bridgehead once gained. The two days'
fighting of the 31st August and the 1st September may
therefore be described as the Battle of Mont St Quentin,
and our task is now to deal with the part taken in it by
the 2/4th Battalion.</p>

<p>The 31st August saw a good deal of heavy fighting by
the 175th Brigade, which was still in line, the chief feature
of the enemy's resistance being the severity of the shell fire
with which his heavy guns plastered the whole Brigade
area. Marrières Wood was captured and the line pushed
on to a position west of the Péronne-Rancourt Road
and overlooking the slope leading down to Bouchavesnes.</p>

<p>At 7 p.m. that night unexpected orders were received
by the 173rd Brigade to return to the line and deliver
an attack at 5.30 a.m. the following morning. From
Bronfay Farm the battalions were conveyed by bus to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
Hem Wood, whence they marched to assembly in the line,
taking it over from the 175th Brigade.</p>

<p>The immediate objective of the attack was the village
of Bouchavesnes, after which the line was to be pushed
forward to a position overlooking the valley of the Tortille
River and the Canal du Nord. The order of battle was:
2/4th Londons on the right, 3rd Londons on the left, with
the 2/2nd Londons following in close support. In spite
of the short notice for the operation the Battalion was
duly assembled without delay on a line 300 yards west
of the Péronne-Rancourt Road, and at zero, 5.30 a.m.,
1st September, moved forward under a creeping barrage.
The advance was made with two companies (A and B,
under Capt. F. J. Griffiths and 2/Lieut. C. C. Gibbs) in
front and two in support (C and D, under 2/Lieuts,
Y. C. Prince, M. C., and G. C. Ewing, M.C.). Each company
moved in artillery formation with three platoons
in front and one in support.</p>

<p>For once we were favoured with good weather conditions,
and though cold the morning was fine with good
visibility. On the western outskirts of Bouchavesnes the
enemy put up a rather stiff fight, but on being tackled
with determination, he once again showed signs of weakening
morale, and the remainder of the village was occupied
and mopped up with very little opposition.</p>

<p>Although the Bosche infantry showed weakness his
artillery work was, as usual, excellent. His counter-barrage
came down promptly and heavily, and the bulk
of our casualties this day were caused by his shell fire.
On several occasions, indeed, during these successful days
of August and September the enemy displayed prodigious
skill in handling his guns. Field guns remained in action
in the copses which are scattered all over this countryside,
firing over open sights till the last possible moment; and
when these were forced to limber up the fire was promptly
taken up by high velocity guns firing at extreme ranges in
the rear. On the 1st September, however, the advance
was particularly rapid, and several field guns were unable
to get away, and fell into our hands. After passing the
village the Battalion pressed forward rapidly up the hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
to the east of it, collecting a good many machine-gun posts
on the way, and by 10.45 a.m. was on its final objective,
organised and established on a definite line under the
personal control of Major Tollworthy. This line was on
the western crest of the Tortille Valley overlooking
Moislains, and about 1000 yards short of that village.
Some little difficulty was experienced by the divisions on
the flanks, but touch was soon gained, the Australians
being still on the right and the 47th Division (who captured
Rancourt and gained the western edge of St Pierre Vaast
Wood) on the left.</p>

<p>No counter-attack developed during the day, and the
Bosche seemed to resign himself to the loss of ground. His
acquiescence in our success was doubtless partly due to
the fact that this day the Australians, after three days'
magnificent fighting, captured Mont St Quentin and entered
Péronne.</p>

<p>The casualties of the 2/4th Battalion were again
extremely light when compared with the importance of
the success achieved, but unfortunately they included the
loss of two company commanders (Capt. F. J. Griffiths
and 2/Lieut. V. C. Prince) killed. Both of these officers
had done splendid work and shown themselves capable
leaders, and in them the Battalion sustained a serious loss.
In addition to these, 2/Lieuts. H. H. Gant and G. Gilson
were killed, Lieut. H. P. Lawrence and 2/Lieuts. F. E.
Rogers, C. Brandram and R. E. Glover wounded; while
11 N.C.O.'s and men were killed, 49 wounded and 30
missing, making a total list for the day of 99 all
ranks.</p>

<p>The captures of the Brigade amounted to 325 prisoners,
40 machine-guns, 8 field guns and one motor ambulance,
and once again the prisoners showed that reserves were
being flung wholesale into the enemy fighting line.
Measured solely by the depth of ground taken, the 1st
September was the most successful action ever fought by
the 2/4th Battalion, the advance being over 3000 yards,
and the achievement was the subject of a congratulatory
message from the Brigadier.</p>

<p>The same evening the 58th Division was relieved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
the 74th<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and passed into Corps reserve after a week of
hard fighting. The 2/4th Battalion withdrew, after
handing over its objectives intact to the 14th Black Watch,
to a valley a mile west of Marrières Wood. The Battalion
remained in this valley for five days, employed in resting
and training, fortunately under weather conditions which
were fine and warm except on the 5th September. During
this period 2/Lieut. D. A. S. Manning and drafts of 21
other ranks joined the Battalion. 2/Lieut. Bidgood was
appointed Intelligence Officer (vice 2/Lieut. Davies, sick).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The 74th Division (Girdwood) was a Yeomanry Division which had
been employed in the East. This was its first appearance in the French
theatre of war. The 14th Black Watch was formerly the Fife and Forfar
Yeomanry.</p></div>

<p>The days succeeding the relief of the 58th Division were
marked by hard fighting, but by the evening of the 4th
September the 47th and 74th Divisions had advanced the line
east of Moislains and well up the long slope leading to Nurlu.
As was to be expected now that the line of the Somme had
been turned the enemy began to fall back towards the next
defensive position, the outposts of the Hindenburg line,
and on the 5th September the pursuit began in earnest,
though it was met at many points with stubborn resistance.</p>

<p>At 7 a.m. on the 7th September the 2/4th Battalion
embussed at Hem Wood and were conveyed to St Pierre
Farm on the Péronne-Nurlu Road, the whole Division
being on its way back to the fighting line. The spectacle
of the roads during this forward move was most impressive.
Packed with troops, guns and stores of every description
moving eastward, it seemed to convey to the troops a
greater realisation of the importance of their victories
than the actual advances they had made in action.</p>

<p>The Battalion lay in Villa Wood, south-west of Nurlu,
during the day, and at 6 p.m. marched to a bivouac area
immediately north of Liéramont, where it arrived at
9.30 p.m.</p>

<p>On the 8th September the fine weather of the preceding
week gave way to heavy rainstorms, and the Battalion
moved into shelters in Liéramont, and in this position it
remained resting until a late hour in the evening of the 9th.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>
<p>During the 8th September troops of the 58th Division
endeavoured to advance against the large and strongly
defended villages of Epéhy and Peizières, but the position
was stubbornly held by the Alpine Corps, and the line
became stabilised in trenches on the south and west slopes
of the hill on which the villages stand. The following
morning determined counter-attacks by the Alpine Corps
drove back the Divisional line a short distance.</p>

<p>This stiffening of the defence made it essential for
Army H.Q. to be informed as to whether the enemy rearguards
were fighting a delaying action, or whether the
defence was organised in depth; and to test this an attack
by the III Corps was ordered for the 10th September.</p>

<p>The 58th Division was directed on Epéhy-Peizières
while the 74th was given Ronnssoy Wood as its objective.</p>

<p>The 173rd Brigade was detailed for this attack with
the 3rd Londons on the right, the 2/2nd on the left and the
2/4th in close support. The great frontage of the two
villages, which topographically are really one, and the
high state of their defences made the operation one of
great difficulty, and the plan of action was to deal with it
in two stages. For the first objective the two leading
battalions were to gain the line of the eastern road of the
villages, the 3rd Londons in Epéhy and the 2/2nd in
Peizières. The 2/4th Londons were to follow the 2/2nd
closely in the initial stages and then, turning southwards,
were to mop up the area between the inner flanks of the
leading battalions and establish themselves in Fishers
Keep as a link between the two.</p>

<p>In the second stage the leading battalions were to gain
the line of the railway east of the villages where they would
join hands, the 2/4th Battalion remaining in the villages.
On the left the 21st Division was to push forward immediately
after the villages were captured and secure the
position by occupying the high ground which dominated
them a mile to the north.</p>

<p>This very complicated operation was to be carried out
under two creeping barrages, one for each leading battalion,
and a machine-gun barrage, while the heavy batteries
would engage distant targets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></p>

<p>At 11 p.m., 9th August, the 2/4th Battalion left its
position in Liéramont and moved forward to assembly,
which, considering the vileness of the weather, the lack
of reconnaissance and the extreme darkness, was completed
satisfactorily; and at 5.15 a.m. the Battalion advanced
to the attack.</p>

<p>The leading battalions met with a good deal of
opposition, which on the left flank was centred on Wood
Farm. In the 2/4th Battalion A and B Companies,
respectively under 2/Lieuts. C. C. Gibbs and G. C. Ewing,
M.C., gained their objective at Tottenham Post on the
western outskirts of Peizières with comparatively little
difficulty. B Company under Capt. Hetley, whose rôle
was to penetrate the villages to Fishers Keep, had a much
more difficult task. The fighting through ruined streets
inevitably led to some disorganisation of platoons, and
the villages, moreover, were stiff with Bosche machine-gun
posts, which, once the barrage had passed over them, were
free to do their worst on the attackers. Severe casualties
were sustained, among whom were numbered two platoon
commanders, 2/Lieuts. H. B. Bartleet and P. F. Royce,
killed. Finding progress impossible among the cunningly
concealed Bosche machine-gunners Hetley collected and
organised his company on the west edge of the village.
A similar fate met D Company (2/Lieut. D. A. S. Manning)
which endeavoured to enter Peizières from the west.
After gallantly struggling against impossible odds Manning
withdrew his men to swell the garrison of Tottenham Post.</p>

<p>The 2/2nd Londons under Capt. Wright made a
magnificent attempt to carry out their task, and did in
fact reach the railway embankment, but a sharp counter-attack
drove them back to the fringe of the village. Unfortunately
the flanking movement of the 21st Division
on the left failed to materialise, and this doubtless contributed
to the failure of the 173rd Brigade. The fact,
however, was clearly established that the resistance of
the enemy was organised and deliberate, and it became
patent that an attack with tank co-operation would be
necessary to reduce it. The rifle strength of the three
battalions set against these villages on the 10th September<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
was only about 900 in all, and their attack, therefore,
lacked the weight essential to success.</p>

<p>In spite of the lack of success, however, the day was
not entirely fruitless, for the captures amounted to 80
prisoners, 20 machine-guns and 3 anti-tank guns.</p>

<p>The 2/4th Battalion's losses were: 2/Lieuts. F. Bidgood,
P. F. Royce and H. B. Bartleet, killed; 2/Lieut. F. J.
Paterson, wounded; 5 N.C.O.'s and men killed, 19
wounded and 3 missing.</p>

<p>During the night following the battle the 2/4th Battalion
was relieved by the 12th Londons, and was concentrated
in trenches at Guyencourt. Here it remained till 8 p.m.
on the 11th September, when it withdrew to shelters in
Liéramont.</p>

<p>We may here remark that on the 18th September the
173rd Brigade captured Epéhy and Peizières and thus helped
clear the road for the advance to the Hindenburg line.</p>

<p>We have now come to the end of the 2/4th Battalion's
story. Owing to the increasing difficulties of maintaining
units at fighting strength it had been decided by G.H.Q.
to make still further reductions in the number of formations,
and to swell the ranks of those remaining with the
personnel of those disbanded. This dismal fate befell
the 2/4th Londons, and on the 12th September 1918 the
whole of its personnel was transferred to the 2/2nd
Londons, and the Battalion as a separate entity ceased
to exist, after twenty-one months of active service life.
Its place in the Brigade was taken by the 2/24th Londons
from the 32nd Division.</p>

<p>The last action in which the Battalion fought was
admittedly a "feeler," and as such undoubtedly served
a useful purpose in the scheme of the Fourth Army's great
advance; but perhaps we may be pardoned for regretting
that it was not a more successful close to the Battalion's
history. It was bad luck. Yet there was a certain degree
of poetic justice in the fact that the Battalion had helped
fight the Germans back to what had been on 21st March
1918 the British line of resistance, and it can, therefore,
justly claim to have redeemed in full its losses in the awful
battles of the retreat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

THE FINAL ADVANCE</h2>


<h3>II. <em>The 1/4th Battalion in the Battle of Bapaume, 1918</em></h3>

<p>The extension northward of the battle line, which marked
the opening of the Battle of Bapaume on the 21st August
1918, involved Byng's Third Army, comprising from right
to left the V, IV and VI Corps. As we have indicated in
the preceding chapter, the object of the Third Army was
to conduct a vast enveloping movement which should turn
the flank of the German defence of the Somme line, and
throw open the road to Cambrai and St Quentin.</p>

<p>Already the enemy had shown signs of nervousness in
the area of the Somme-Scarpe salient and had withdrawn
from his most advanced positions at Serre; and it was
clear, therefore, that any attack on this front by the
British must be prosecuted rapidly to avoid a repetition
of the skilful German retreat of February 1917. For an
offensive in this area the British troops were far more
favourably placed in August 1918 than they had been on
the former occasion. They possessed the Bucquoy Ridge,
with the consequent advantages of observation which had
formerly been denied to them; and the terrain over which
the battle would be fought, though certainly devastated
and a mass of trenches, did not present the colossal system
of inter-supporting fortresses which it had in 1916. The
time for a big attack had come, and G.H.Q. decided to
strike. The 23rd August saw the Fourth and Third Armies
advancing on a front of 33 miles from Lihons to Mercatel.</p>

<p>The suddenness of the German collapse in these latter
days of the War is probably unique in the annals of military
history. At the beginning of June their star was still in
the ascendant. They were occupying ground which they
had never previously held during the whole War; their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
successes of March and April had shaken the Allied defence
to its very foundations; and it seemed still doubtful
whether they had reached the limit of their capabilities of
offence. Yet by the middle of August the whole face of
the War had changed. On a wide front the Germans were
in retreat; vast masses of material, thousands of prisoners
had fallen into our hands; the British morale had been
proved stronger than ever, while that of the enemy was
giving indications of a serious break.</p>

<p>Whether the High Command anticipated the completeness
of this lightning change we cannot say; that the
vast bulk of regimental officers and men scarcely contemplated
it, is almost certain. Early in July General
Hull, in a conversation with Lieut.-Col. Marchment, expressed
the opinion that very little would be done in 1918
by way of retrieving the losses suffered during the spring!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The 8th August found the 1/4th Londons at a strength
of 42 officers and 892 other ranks withdrawn in Brigade
reserve to billets at Arras. Here a quite pleasant week
was spent in which the routine of training was varied by a
Battalion sports meeting, and a most successful swimming
gala&mdash;a new feature of recreation&mdash;for which purpose the
moat at the Citadel formed a splendid bath.</p>

<p>Between the 16th and 18th August the 56th Division
was relieved from the Tilloy trenches and passed into
Corps reserve, the 1/4th Londons handing over their
Brigade reserve billets to the 1/9th Royal Scots and
moving to Berneville on the 17th August. For a few days
changes of station followed on each others' heels with
startling rapidity, and after having been quartered successively
at Houvin-Houvigneuil and Magnicourt-sur-Canche,
the Battalion reached Grand Rullecourt at 11.30
p.m. on the 20th August.</p>

<p>On the 19th orders had been issued to the Division to
take part in an attack with the XVII Corps in the area of
the Scarpe, but these were subsequently replaced on the
21st August by a transfer of the Division to Haldane's
VI Corps, and orders to join with it in the Third Army attack.</p>

<p>A day of rest at Grand Rullecourt was occupied by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
Battalion, in the absence of attack orders, with speculations
as to its chances of soon being called upon to fight.
Preliminary arrangements were made to march into battle
at short notice, and the same evening, the 21st August,
the Battalion marched thirteen miles to Berles-au-Bois,
arriving at 2 a.m. on the 22nd.</p>

<p>About 10 o'clock that morning Lieut.-Col. Marchment
and the company commanders were ordered to Humbercamp
to receive battle orders, but after an hour's fruitless
waiting the company commanders returned to prepare
their companies for action, and the Colonel went to try
and get what orders he could at Brigade Headquarters.
Here he was informed that the attack would take place in
sixteen hours' time&mdash;early on the 23rd August! The
general idea of the Battalion's rôle was explained to
Lieut.-Col. Marchment to be the capture of the village of
Boyelles and the Marc system of trenches immediately
north of it, the attack to commence at 4.55 a.m. on the
23rd August, two companies in line, one in support and
one in reserve. Artillery support would be provided by
6 brigades of field guns firing an unregistered barrage,
while 21 tanks would take part in the attack. A section
of the Divisional Machine-gun Company would be attached
to the Battalion. With this somewhat sketchy information
Lieut.-Col. Marchment hurried back to the Battalion
to set it in motion, and by 5 p.m. it was on its way to the
first assembly position at Blairville. Here it occupied
the old German trenches exactly opposite the first trench
sector ever held by the 2/4th Battalion in February 1917.</p>

<p>The line facing Boyelles was at this time occupied by
the 59th Division, and the 168th Brigade was detailed to
attack through them, with the Guards Division opposite
Hamelincourt on its right, and the 52nd Division north
of the north branch of the Cojeul River on its left. The
Brigade order of battle from right to left was Kensingtons
(south of Boyelles); 1/4th Londons (Boyelles); and
London Scottish (Boiry-Becquerelle); the 1st Londons
being attached in Brigade reserve for the operation.</p>

<p>Leaving the Battalion on the march Lieut.-Col.
Marchment hurried on to Blairville by car to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
Brigadier of the brigade in line (59th Division) and was
at once faced by another difficulty in finding that the
59th Division had themselves taken over the front trenches
only the preceding night! Clearly not much possibility
of assistance from them; but they arranged to provide
guides to lead our platoons to the positions of final assembly.</p>

<p>The sudden transfer of the 56th Division from the XVII
to the VI Corps, and the subsequent difficulty in obtaining
orders must have been caused by some reason of great
importance: we are not aware what it was. Certainly
the effect was not to make things easier. Indeed, when
the Divisional attack order was issued by Gen. Hull at
3 p.m. on the 22nd August he had not received the written
instructions of VI Corps. But, starting under such
inauspicious circumstances, all the more credit is due to
the battalions, and in particular to the commanding
officers, for the signal successes which were ultimately
achieved. Reconnaissance of the ground by officers and
N.C.O.'s was obviously out of the question, and Lieut.-Col.
Marchment had to content himself with explaining the
situation to them while battle stores were issued to the men.</p>

<p>At 10.30 p.m. the Battalion moved off by platoons in
charge of the 59th Division guides, who, considering their
own scanty acquaintance with the ground, did well, for
they brought almost the whole Battalion to its assembly
positions in Falcon Trench well on time, though one
platoon of A Company and the Headquarter details went
sadly astray and did not turn up till long after zero hour.
The Padre believes he was taken for a long walk somewhere
round Albert! During the march up the enemy
was using gas shell freely, and masks had to be worn at
times, but little loss was caused.</p>

<p>The Battalion was drawn up as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Battalion was drawn up as follows">
  <tr>
    <td>Right front</td>
    <td>&mdash;B Company, Capt. R. S. B. Simmonds.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Left front</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reserve</td>
    <td>&mdash;A Company, Capt. H. N. Williams, M.C.</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

<p>The hour or two of darkness before zero was spent
in cutting lanes through our wire, and at 4.55 a.m. the
barrage opened, intense and well distributed. Lieut.-Col.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
Marchment describes it as the best and most tremendous
he had ever seen. The scene from Headquarters was
extraordinary: the intense shrapnel barrage and smoke
on the German front line, the medium howitzers firing on
Boyelles village beyond, and the heavies cutting up the
distant landscape in dense black clouds; and behind it
all the sun just rising.</p>

<p>At 5.7 a.m. the companies moved forward. The right
company (B) made good use of the railway embankment,
and following the line on its south side advanced on a
one-platoon frontage to Boyelles Station, while three tanks
entered the village. Here the railway was crossed and a
good deal of opposition was met with from enemy machine-guns,
heavy and light, firing from the eastern half of the
village. These were, however, skilfully outflanked and
rounded up to the number of 3 heavy and 8 light guns,
after which the company pushed forward and caught up
the barrage.</p>

<p>Two platoons halted approximately on the Blue line
(first objective) on the eastern edge of Boyelles, while two
pressed on to Boyelles Trench 500 yards further east. But
few enemy were encountered in this advanced position.
B Company being now well distributed in depth, the work
of consolidation was put in hand. The right flank was not
yet in touch with the Kensingtons and was therefore
rounded off by pushing two Lewis gun sections and one
subsection M.G.C. southwards towards the railway.</p>

<p>D Company on the left met with more stubborn resistance
in the Marc system, and the leading platoons were
temporarily held up in No Man's Land by enemy firing from
the Marc saps. Moreover, the tank allotted to this part
of the front failed to reach the Marc front system at all,
having apparently lost its way. The support company
(C), however, pushed a platoon forward into the sunken
road leading northwards from Boyelles, whence it was
able to enfilade the Marc trenches, while the right platoon
of the London Scottish advancing on our left managed to
turn the position similarly from the north. Being practically
surrounded the enemy surrendered <i lang="fr">en masse</i>, the
bag amounting to 2 officers and 80 other ranks. Little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
further opposition was encountered, and D company
continued the advance to Boyelles Trench, where touch
was gained with C Company on the right and the London
Scottish on the left. The dugouts in this line were
energetically mopped up and many Germans sent marching
westward. Two patrols were sent forward towards
Boyelles Reserve.</p>

<p>In the meantime the support company mopped up
the neighbourhood of the cemetery and the sunken roads
in its vicinity, while A Company in reserve occupied the
Marc system. This latter proved a very sound move as
our start-line was heavily shelled all the morning.</p>

<p>The first news of the attack at Battalion Headquarters
was received in the shape of Private Cohen, who appeared
wounded but carrying a German light machine-gun&mdash;a
good omen of success! At about 9 a.m. the lost platoons
turned up and their arrival, including as they did the Padre
and the Medical Officer, was extremely welcome, for by
now the wounded were beginning to filter through, and
the small band of five under Lieut.-Col. Marchment were
encumbered with some 200 Bosche prisoners&mdash;not to
speak of their duties of conducting the battle. Communication
by wire was rapidly established with brigade
and also forward to the companies, a report centre being
formed north of Boyelles.</p>

<p>At 9.15 a.m. 56th Division issued orders that the
attack would be pressed at 11.30 a.m. into Boyelles
Reserve, but owing to temporary dislocation of the signal
service these orders did not reach the 1/4th Londons until
11.15 a.m. To start at the scheduled hour was out of
the question, but arrangements were made at once for the
further advance, which ultimately began at about 5 p.m.</p>

<p>The advance was made by the left front and support
companies, the right front company extending to its left
to cover the area vacated by them. This second attack
met with complete success. The two attacking companies
were led by a line of scouts followed by one platoon
in extended formation. The remaining platoons followed
in artillery formation by sections. Some resistance was
offered by light machine-gun teams in Boyelles Reserve,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
but the widely extended formation saved the attackers
from severe loss. The enemy artillery was also active
during the advance, but again the formation adopted
enabled the rear platoons to pick their way with but few
casualties. The whole of the allotted portion of Boyelles
Reserve was captured, and patrols pushed forward 500
yards to the east of it. The enemy shell fire now became
more intense, but a protective barrage was put down by
our guns, and no counter-attack developed. After a
while activity on the whole area subsided.</p>

<p>The same evening the 168th Brigade handed over the
captured positions to the 167th and passed into Divisional
reserve, the 1/4th Londons concentrating north of Hendecourt.
By noon on that day the Battalion was back at
Blairville.</p>

<p>It is impossible to speak too highly of the men
by whom this great success had been gained. The long
approach marches in exceptionally hot weather brought
the Battalion to the point of battle in an already tired
condition; the hurried orders and the total lack of previous
reconnaissance created difficulties which were surmounted
by the splendid response made by all ranks to the demands
imposed on them. The rapid appreciation of the situation
by company commanders and the careful dispositions of
the commanding officer all contributed in full measure to
this important victory, while the skilful use of ground
and of suitable formations was the means of securing the
gains at a minimum of loss. The excellent work performed
by signallers and runners, all of whom had a hard
day's work, were of incalculable value to Battalion Headquarters,
and enabled Lieut.-Col. Marchment at all times
to keep a firm grip of the situation of the moment.</p>

<p>The casualties of the Battalion were extremely light,
only 18 being killed, but by ill luck it lost three company
commanders, Capts. C. W. Rowlands, M.C., and H. A. T.
Hewlett being killed, and Capt. R. S. B. Simmonds,
wounded. 2/Lieuts. A. W. Chignell, T. Yoxall and
F. S. C. Taylor were wounded. The captures made by
the Battalion amounted to 3 officers and 240 other
ranks, of the 1st and 2nd Battalions 87th R.I. Regiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
24 light and 8 heavy machine-guns, 6 light, 1 medium
and 1 heavy trench mortar.</p>

<p>After the relief of the 168th Brigade the offensive was
continued by the 167th, at first with considerable success,
the Division being once again attached to the XVII Corps.
An advance in the northern area of the Divisional front
of some 2500 yards was made into Summit and Fooley
Trenches, but on the south flank the most strenuous
efforts of the 56th and Guards Divisions failed to eject
the enemy from Croisilles, which was held in great force
by machine-gunners. South of the Cojeul River the
enemy resistance was increasing, and information was
obtained from prisoners to the effect that three fresh
German divisions had been brought into the Bullecourt-Hendecourt
area. North of the Cojeul, however, the
52nd and Canadian Divisions had registered important
successes. The old Wancourt line fell to them on the
26th, and this advance was rapidly followed up by the
recapture of Monchy-le-Preux, and a penetration into
quite new ground at St Rohart Factory&mdash;hardly fought
for by the 56th Division in May 1917&mdash;and at Boiry
Notre Dame. By the evening of the 26th August the
52nd Division had cleared the Hindenburg line from
Henin to the Sensée River, and was reported to be east
of Fontaine-lez-Croisilles.</p>

<p>Croisilles, however, still held out and the Guards had
been pressed back slightly towards St Leger. The result
of this fighting was to swing the Corps line round facing
roughly south-east astride the Hindenburg line, with a
strong pocket of most stubborn Bosche in the ramification
of trenches around Croisilles itself, and on both banks of
the Sensée River to the north-east.</p>

<p>The 169th Brigade which had now taken over the
Divisional front was getting worn by its constant fighting
and losses, and reinforcement was needed. After a few
hours' rest at Blairville the 1/4th Londons marched at
7.45 a.m. on the 25th August to trenches in front of
Boisleux St Marc, moving the following evening to the
trenches east of Boiry-Becquerelle, which had been captured
by the London Scottish on the 23rd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span></p>

<p>A good deal of gas shelling occurred here during the
night. A signaller was killed and several men were
wounded, among whom the Battalion was unfortunate
in losing Sergt. Johnson, the excellent orderly-room clerk,
and Corpl. Coates, M.M., of the Scouts.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 27th the Battalion moved
forward in close support to the 169th Brigade, and occupied
Summit Trench immediately north of its junction with Hill,
and on the extreme left of the Divisional sector.</p>

<p>It is rather curious to note that in these fights and
marches the 1/4th Battalion was in an area which had
been traversed by the 2/4th Battalion during the actions
of March 1917, while at the same time the 2/4th Battalion
in the Fourth Army was bearing its share in recapturing
spots familiar to the 1/4th Battalion during the 1916
Somme battles!</p>

<p>The 1/4th Battalion had settled down in Summit
Trench to make the best of a very wet evening, when,
after dark, orders were received to move at once into the
Hindenburg line and to concentrate at River Road, near
the banks of the Sensée River for an attack the following
morning on Bullecourt. It had been determined, owing
to the prolonged resistance of the enemy at Croisilles
and the resultant holding back of the right flank, to
pursue the operation by an advance towards Bullecourt
straight down the Hindenburg line. This would have
the effect of completely enveloping and "squeezing-out"
the pocket of Germans in the Croisilles-Guardian Trench
area.</p>

<p>The concentration of the Battalion was effected successfully,
but not altogether without difficulty. A and
B Companies moved direct to the point of assembly, while
C, D and Headquarters proceeded by way of the Henin-Fontaine
Road, and then down the Hindenburg trenches.
The whole area was horribly congested. Two brigades
of the 56th Division (the 168th and 169th) were moving
up for attack, while at the same time a relief was proceeding
on the left flank between the 52nd and 57th
Divisions. For a time the confusion was rather distressing,
and Lieut.-Col. Marchment writes, "It seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
to me that the battalions were forming up to attack
north-east, south-east and south-west."</p>

<p>The plan of attack was as follows:&mdash;The advance was
to be led over the open by the 169th Brigade, the Queen's
Westminsters in the van with the line Queen's Lane-Jove
Lane, as a first objective, and the trenches south-east of
Bullecourt as a final objective.</p>

<p>The 168th Brigade was to follow the 169th in the
order 1/4th Londons, Kensingtons and London Scottish,
advancing by bounds at a distance of about 1000 yards
in rear of the rear battalion of the 169th Brigade. The
particular duties of the 168th Brigade were to support the
169th and mop up in rear of their advance, and to protect
the right flank should Croisilles remain untaken&mdash;a rather
difficult and quite unsatisfactory job.</p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons were disposed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hangindent8">

<p>D Company (2/Lieut. J. L. Backhouse) on the right&mdash;to advance
over the area west of the Hindenburg line by way of
Sensée Avenue, Nelly Avenue and Queen's Lane.</p>

<p>B Company (2/Lieut. G. G. Lewis) to advance down Burg
Support, the old Hindenburg front trench.</p>

<p>A Company (Capt. H. N. Williams, M.C.) and C Company
(Capt. J. W. Price), Headquarters and 1 section M.G.C.
attached, to advance down Tunnel Trench, the old
Hindenburg support trench.</p></div>

<p>The attack was to be launched at 12.30 p.m. on the
24th August under a creeping barrage.</p>

<p>The fight throughout the day proved a laborious
and confused affair. Trouble developed which doubtless
originated on the previous evening when the Queen's
Westminsters, relieved by the London Scottish in the
Summit area, had moved forward to assembly. This
gallant regiment had been fighting already for a couple
of days and was getting worn&mdash;Lieut.-Col. Savill describes
his men as "dead beat"&mdash;and it had to move up to
assembly positions in Burg Support, where it occupied a
trench at right angles to the line of its advance. A change
of front during an advance had been proved on the Somme
in 1916 to be an operation extremely difficult of accomplishment,
and so it proved here. True, the attack did
not start till 12.30 p.m., but even the hours of morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
daylight gave little chance to the Queen's Westminsters
to get their bearings. Our map shows the villages of
Bullecourt and Hendecourt, but it must be borne in mind
that the whole terrain was actually a featureless waste.
The ground everywhere was "crumped" to pieces and
covered with high grass and rank weeds, while the existence
of a village was not suspected till one found oneself
stumbling among the heaps of bricks which had formerly
been its cottages. As a consequence of all this, two
companies of the Queen's Westminsters, followed by a
part of the 1/2nd Londons, went hopelessly astray and
became entangled in the 57th Division troops near
Hendecourt. To add to the confusion the company
commander sent back word to 169th Brigade that he
was in Bullecourt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lieut.-Col. Savill of the Queen's Westminsters
advanced along the Hindenburg line, and having
fallen in with the Headquarters of the 1/2nd Londons and
the London Rifle Brigade, soon came in touch with strong
enemy forces, believing that his companies were ahead of
him, and that mopping-up had not been well done. The
weak force at his disposal was unable to shift the stubborn
Germans opposed to him, and the attack was held up.</p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons moved off from assembly as ordered
in rear of the 169th Brigade.</p>

<p>On the right D Company was held up badly at Nelly
Avenue where it closed on to a party of the London Rifle
Brigade. Several efforts to shift the enemy proved
abortive, and it was not until about 7.30 p.m. that, with
the help of two Stokes Mortars brought up by the
Kensingtons, further progress could be made. By this
hour, however, the opposition was overcome, and, with
40 prisoners and 4 light machine-guns to its credit, the
company pursued the advance after dark to Queen's Lane.</p>

<p>B Company in Burg Support overtook the Headquarters
of the three 169th Brigade battalions, held up as already
described, about 200 yards short of the Hump, and a
platoon was at once placed at Lieut.-Col. Savill's disposal
to help clear the trench. We must remark parenthetically
that B Company's fight began almost precisely in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
sector of trench which had been first captured by A
Company of the 2/4th Battalion on the 15th June 1917:
how often, we wonder, has such a coincidence occurred?</p>

<p>The Germans in Burg Support were of a remarkably
obstinate variety and progress by bombing was slow.
The trench was very full of men, and the congestion was
later increased by the arrival from nowhere in particular
of a company of the Royal Munster Fusiliers (57th Division),
who had quite lost their direction. By 6.30 p.m. the
enemy's resistance was overcome by hard fighting, and B
Company advanced down Burg Support to the Knuckle,
where it established itself in touch with D Company on its
right.</p>

<p>A and C Companies on the left, in the Hindenburg
Support line, also overtook the 169th Brigade, the
remnants of the 1/2nd Londons being held up about Juno
Lane. The enemy was in strength in this trench also.
At the time it was presumed that by zealous use of his
dugouts he had escaped the moppers-up of the leading
battalion, but probably, owing to the deflection of the
greater part of the 1/2nd Londons, he had not been previously
attacked. Progress was slow and the 1/4th
London Companies pushed through and engaged the
enemy. The resistance at Juno was soon overcome, and
the enemy retired leaving us a few prisoners and two
light machine-guns. A second check was experienced at
the Hump but the enemy was driven back, strenuously
debating every inch of ground, till at last by 9.30 p.m.
the two 1/4th London Companies reached Jove Lane and
the remainder of the Battalion. Attempts were made to
gain touch with the 57th Division on the left but without
success.</p>

<p>The stubbornness of the enemy resistance in the
Hindenburg line this day was remarkable, and we cannot
deny a brave enemy an acknowledgment of his valour.
Croisilles had been reported vacant by 8 o'clock in the
morning but the occupants of the Guardian pocket put
up a day-long fight. It was not till late in the evening
that the whole area was cleared. Probably the need to
the enemy of gradually evacuating this area was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
cause of the opposition offered to our advance down the
Hindenburg line.</p>

<p>This was a hard day's work for everyone. The 1/4th
Londons had bombed their way down about 2000 yards
of the Hindenburg line, excellent leadership to the
bombing parties being provided by Lieut. V. R. Oldrey and
by Capts. H. N. Williams and J. W. Price. The great
difficulty throughout the day was for local commanders
to get any sort of grip as to what was going on, as so often
occurs in trench fighting. The mass of trenches, nearly
all stubbornly defended, with which the whole area was
pitted, in effect broke up the brigade attack into a series
of numerous and more or less isolated scraps in which no
one knew much of how his neighbour was faring. And
all the time Division believed that the Hindenburg line
was clear, and that Bullecourt was in our hands.</p>

<p>The night of the 28th and the morning of the 29th
August were occupied in clearing up the situation, and
assembling the Brigades on the line Pelican Avenue-Pelican
Lane for a continuance of the attack, which was
pursued by the 168th Brigade on the right and the 169th
on the left.</p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons remained on the 29th August in
support with the 1st Londons (attached), the attacking
battalions being the Kensingtons on the right and the
London Scottish on the left. The Battalion was disposed
in Queen's Lane, Burg Support and Borderer Trench.
The objective allotted to the Brigade roughly coincided
with the Riencourt-Quéant Road, and the whole of the
village of Bullecourt, inclusive to the Brigade, was allotted
to the London Scottish.</p>

<p>The attack, which was launched at 1 p.m. on the 29th
August, met with stubborn resistance, especially on the
right where the Kensingtons were held up at Bullecourt
Station. After hard fighting the London Scottish managed
to capture the village, and by dusk the Divisional line
formed a sharp salient, with its horns on Bullecourt
Station and the high ground west of the Factory on the
Hendecourt Road, and its apex following Tower Reserve
and Gordon Reserve Trenches.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span></p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons were not called upon as a Battalion,
but D Company was sent forward to reinforce the London
Scottish, and later to fill a gap in the forward positions
between that Battalion and the 169th Brigade on the left.</p>

<p>The enemy resistance this day was extremely stubborn
and Tank Reserve was strongly held by the enemy, who
resisted effectually the most gallant attempts of the
Scottish to emerge from Gordon Reserve.</p>

<p>Late at night the 167th Brigade took over the whole
Divisional front, and the 1/4th Londons moved back at
5.30 a.m. to positions in Queen's Lane, Knuckle Avenue,
Stray Reserve and Burg Support, where they remained
throughout the 30th August. During the withdrawal to
these positions the whole area was intensely bombarded
with high explosives and gas shell, and it was no surprise
to the Battalion to learn that the enemy had delivered
a sharp counter-attack in the early morning and driven
the 167th Brigade out of Bullecourt back to the Pelican
Avenue-Pelican Lane line. The posts north of the village
stood firm. This counter-attack was a big affair which
affected the divisions right and left, both of them being
pushed back a certain distance.</p>

<p>The immediate recapture of Bullecourt was promptly
ordered by XVII Corps, and no one in the Battalion was
especially delighted to learn that the 1/4th Londons were
detailed for the duty.</p>

<p>After a day spent in obtaining such rest as was possible,
the Battalion wearily crept off after dark to assembly in
Pelican Lane and Borderer Trench in readiness to assault
Bullecourt at dawn on the 31st August. The 168th
Brigade was drawn up for battle with the London Scottish
on the right, the 1/4th Londons in the centre and the
7th Middlesex (167th Brigade attached) on the left, each
battalion having a section M.G.C. and a section L.T.M.
Battery at its disposal. The Kensingtons were in Brigade
reserve.</p>

<p>The morning of the 31st August was dark, and at
5 a.m. the assaulting battalions moved forward under an
excellent barrage to which the enemy gave a quick and
heavy reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span></p>

<p>On the right, C Company, on a two-platoon front,
reached the cross-roads at the extreme western edge of
Bullecourt, but was here held up for some time by machine-guns
in the village. At the same time D Company, on the
left, advancing on the north side of the village penetrated
about half-way across it and almost reached the cross-roads
on the northern edge, but here they also were checked
by machine-gun fire, principally from their right flank.</p>

<p>The support company (B) now entered the village, or
rather advanced against the site of the village (for no
single building was visible), and began to mop up in
the endeavour to form a link between the two leading
companies. Progress was slow owing to the overgrown
nature of the ground, but by 8.40 a.m. touch was gained
between B and C Companies, and together they slowly
fought their way forward till C Company was able to join
hands with the 7th Middlesex on the Hendecourt Road.
In the course of this fighting B Company managed to take
15 prisoners and put 5 machine-guns out of action.</p>

<p>At about 9 a.m. the reserve company (A) was put into
the fight to endeavour to fill in the gap across the village
between the leading companies.</p>

<p>The right company was still held up on the southern
fringe of Bullecourt by two machine-guns mounted in a
derelict tank east of the village, and it was not until after
noon that, with the aid of two Stokes Mortars, progress
was made by bombing up Tower Reserve as far as a point
level with the east edge of the village. Here all further
advance was definitely checked. Gordon Reserve was
strongly held and stubbornly defended, and, moreover,
no touch could be gained with the London Scottish on
the right.</p>

<p>By 3.30 p.m. the village of Bullecourt was reported
clear of the enemy and a line of Lewis gun posts was
established on its eastern fringe from Tower Reserve to
the Hendecourt Road on the left. During the remainder
of the day no material change in the situation occurred.
Three several attempts were made by the leading companies
to get into Gordon Reserve but the position was
too strongly held, and, the trenches leading to it having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
been flattened out by shell fire, an advance by bombing
was impracticable. Shortly after midday aerial reports
were received that the enemy was assembling in Tank
Avenue and Tank Support. All field guns and heavies
at once turned on to this target and the projected counter-attack
was promptly broken up. The activity of the enemy
in this region continued till late at night, and it was evident
that any attempt at further advance would be strenuously
disputed.</p>

<p>After nightfall arrangements were made for one company
of the Kensingtons to rush Gordon Reserve under
cover of Stokes Mortar fire, but the situation remaining
somewhat obscure the attempt was abandoned.</p>

<p>Very little progress was made anywhere this day. On
the right the London Scottish gained Bullecourt Avenue
and the 7th Middlesex on the left captured the factory on
the Hendecourt Road. But all along the line the enemy's
resistance was stiffening, evidently in view of the near
approach of our positions to the junction of the Hindenburg
line with the Drocourt-Quéant Switch.</p>

<p>Moreover the country was difficult for the attackers;
it had been fought over many times and was utterly
broken up, and the assaulting companies were all tired.
In the circumstances it was a good day's work, and a day
of peculiar satisfaction to the 4th London Regiment,
which has a special claim to association with the village of
Bullecourt. Here in 1917 the 2/4th Battalion occupied
Gordon Reserve in the successful defence of Bullecourt
against a heavy German attack after it had first fallen into
British hands, and in August 1918 it fell to the lot of the
1/4th Battalion, after the village had been recaptured and
again lost, to capture it for ever.</p>

<p>Casualties in officers this day were: Lieut. V. R.
Oldrey and 2/Lieut. R. T. Stevenson, killed; 2/Lieuts.
W. G. Hook, A. Holloway and A. F. Potter, wounded.
2/Lieut. E. H. Garner was killed on the night 27th/28th
August, after having been ten days only with the Battalion.
In the ranks the total casualties for the period 23rd to 31st
August were 30 killed, 150 wounded and 12 missing.
Having regard to the enormous importance of the successes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
achieved and the depth of the advances, these comparatively
light figures are a matter for much congratulation.
One shudders to think of what the losses would have been
for equal results in the hard slogging of the Somme in
1916 or at Ypres in 1917.</p>

<p>Late at night on the 31st August the 56th Division
handed over its positions to the 52nd and withdrew into
Corps reserve, the 1/4th Londons reaching the Boyelles
Reserve area at Boiry-Becquerelle at 7 a.m. on the 1st
September, with a strength of 32 officers and 710 other
ranks.</p>

<p>In view of the gallant share which the 1/4th Londons
had borne in this splendid series of victories we may
perhaps be permitted to quote an extract from an article
on the subject of the 56th Division's achievements which
appeared in <cite>The Times</cite> of the 16th September 1918:
" ... This year it was one of the divisions which beat
off the German attack towards Arras on March 28th when
the enemy suffered one of the bloodiest defeats of the
whole War; so that with this fighting and that at Cambrai
to its credit it has probably killed as many Germans as any
division in the British Army. Now to this proud record
is to be added the splendid advance of which the Commander-in-Chief
has told. The 56th Division has proved
itself a great fighting division."</p>

<p>The Divisional record in the Battle of Bapaume 1918
may be summarised as advancing through 6 miles of very
strongly fortified country in nine days; meeting and defeating
three German divisions, and capturing 29 officers,
1047 other ranks, 3 guns, 210 machine-guns and over 50
trench mortars. Of this large booty the share of the
1/4th Londons amounted to 3 officers and 390 other ranks
prisoners, 70 machine-guns and 10 trench mortars&mdash;a very
fair proportion of the whole!</p>

<p>With this action the share of the Battalion in the
great envelopment of the Somme line closes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This great battle as a whole resulted in the defeat by
23 British divisions of 35 German divisions, and the
capture of 34,000 prisoners and 270 guns. Its importance
lay in the ever-increasing signs of the enemy's failing
morale; while the captures bore witness to his indiscriminate
throwing-in of reserves.</p>

<p>The following day Péronne fell to troops of the Third
Army, and two days later the enemy's general retirement
from the east bank of the Somme began.</p>

<p>We have already alluded to extensive captures of
ground made in the area of the Scarpe at Monchy-le-Preux
and other places. These important victories constituted
the Battle of the Scarpe, 1918, in which, beginning on the
26th August, the battle front was still further widened and
the British First Army also became involved. By the 3rd
September the Canadian Corps of the First Army and the
XVII Corps of the Third Army had carried the battle line
forward through the famous Drocourt-Quéant line, and
the enemy had fallen back to the general line of the Canal
du Nord from its junction with the Sensée River, east of
Lécluse to Péronne.</p>

<p>During this hasty retirement large numbers of prisoners
and vast quantities of stores fell into our hands. In the
extreme south the French armies also continued to advance,
and by the 6th September had regained the line of the
Crozat Canal at La Fère.</p>

<p>In the meantime the gradual relinquishment by the
enemy of his advanced positions in the Lys salient had
begun on the 18th August, and the retirement rapidly
becoming general, he had been driven back by the 6th
September to the line Givenchy-Neuve Chapelle-Ploegsteert.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />

THE FINAL ADVANCE</h2>


<h3>III. <i>The 1/4th Battalion in the Battles of Cambrai and
The Sambre, 1918</i></h3>

<p>The changes which the Battalion found at Boiry-Becquerelle
in the few days which had elapsed since its last rest
there were truly astonishing. The rapidity of the advance
had released Boiry from risk of bombardment by all except
long range guns, and the necessity for the supply services
to keep pace with the fighting troops in their progress
eastward had already resulted in a complete metamorphosis
of the Boyelles-Boiry area. Already Boyelles
Station was a hive of industry, and trains were daily
entering it from Arras with supplies. In Boiry-Becquerelle
itself, which had been in German hands till the 23rd August,
the 1/4th Londons were able to enjoy the luxury of baths
and clean clothing on the 2nd September.</p>

<p>The few days' rest obtained here were passed pleasantly
amid fine weather in refitting and reorganisation; and the
Battalion was fortunately able on the 4th September to
commemorate the fourth anniversary of its departure from
England. Companies were now commanded as follows:
A by Capt. H. N. Williams, M.C.; B by Capt. L. L. Watts,
M.M.; C by Capt. C. L. Henstridge, M.C.; and D by Capt.
T. B. Cooper, M.C., M.M.</p>

<p>About this time the Battalion Transport, which had
been stationed at Boisleux St Marc, was divided into two
echelons, of which A was the fighting and B the supply
portion. These two echelons were respectively commanded
by Lieut. G. V. Lawrie, M.C., and Lieut. G. E. Stanbridge.
Although as a rule the two portions moved together, they
were each self-contained and ready to operate separately
in case of a sudden and rapid advance.</p>

<p>In the meantime the remainder of the XVII Corps was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
busily chasing the enemy through Quéant, Pronville and
down the Arras-Cambrai Road to a point between Villers-lez-Cagnicourt
and Buissy. After a warning order to the
56th Division to move forward again into the Corps area
of battle, arrangements were suddenly changed&mdash;as on
numerous other occasions&mdash;and on the 5th September
the Division was transferred to the XXII Corps (Godley)
of the First Army, with orders to relieve the 1st Division
in the line.</p>

<p>East of Vis-en-Artois and south of Douai is a stretch
of country well watered by numerous streams, and intersected
by many ponds and marshes. At Eterpigny the
Cojeul and Sensée Rivers join, and thus augmented the
Sensée expands at Etaing into what is practically a chain
of lakes. Augmented by the Trinquis River and connected
by it to the Scarpe, the Sensée flows eastward past Lécluse,
Palluel and Aubigny-au-Bac. At Palluel it receives on
its right, or south, bank the equally marshy streams of
the Agache and the Hirondelle and is intersected by the
northern extremity of the Canal du Nord, which here links
up with the Canal de la Sensée. This last-named Canal
runs southward from Douai to Arleux and then turning
eastward down the river valley joins the Canal de l'Escaut.
The whole area thus constitutes a thoroughly complicated
system of waterways and marshes which form barriers of
very great natural strength to an advance.</p>

<p>The Sensée marshes from Etaing to Palluel had formed
the left flank of the Canadian Corps advance in its break
through the Drocourt-Quéant line during the Battle of the
Scarpe, and now formed a natural defensive flank, facing
northwards, to our advanced positions on the Canal du
Nord. In this area the 56th Division relieved the 1st
Division. On the evening of the 7th September, after a
a halt of one night at Vis-en-Artois, the 1/4th Londons
took over the positions of the 2nd Royal Sussex on a front
from Eterpigny Wood to a point east of Etaing. The line
was continued to Lécluse by the Kensingtons and thence
by the 169th Brigade.</p>

<p>The Battalion was now in country which hitherto had
been in German hands for the whole of the War, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
devastated area was left behind. Villages were still standing
and houses furnished. Indeed, the civilians had still been
in occupation of them during the battle but had now been
moved to the rear by the French Mission. Trenches in
the ordinary sense were here non-existent and the front
was held by a series of outposts along the line of the
Sensée with sentry posts dug in small pits behind the
cover of trees and bushes. D, B, and C Companies were
in line, with A and Headquarters on the hill above Etaing.</p>

<p>Life in this sector was comparatively uneventful. The
defences were improved and a great deal of useful patrolling
work carried out in the endeavour to locate fords or other
means of crossing the swamps in front. For his excellent
reconnaissances and reports Sergt. Heyes, M.M., received
commendation.</p>

<p>The previous occupants of the line had evidently been
cautious in the use of their transport in forward areas, for
rations and stores were dumped each night at a cross-road
about 2000 yards in rear of the line; a course involving
the nightly labours of some 70 men for carrying duties.
The 1/4th Londons altered this and had limbers at night
up to the front line without any mishap, thus saving an
immense amount of fatigue and trouble to everyone.</p>

<p>After reorganising the outpost line to a strength of two
companies the Battalion handed over its positions on the
evening of the 12th September to the 1st Londons (167th
Brigade), and concentrating at St Rohart Factory on the
Arras-Cambrai Road were 'bussed back to Feuchy where
they occupied shelters in Battery Valley, an area which a
month previously they had held as a front line!</p>

<p>In this area a good deal of useful training with rifle and
Lewis gun was put in, and a friendly boxing tournament
with the London Scottish one evening afforded a pleasant
relaxation. The Battalion was here joined by a large
draft of officers, including Lieuts. A. Bath and T. R.
Fletcher, and 2/Lieuts. Bradley, R. D. Bushell, J. Coley,
P. W. Green and S. P. Ferdinando; and 2/Lieut. S. W.
Neville (7th Londons) attached.</p>

<p>Lieut. E. P. M. Mosely's diary for this period affords
an excellent illustration of the care taken to maintain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
discipline of the Battalion at a high standard by the
application of "peace-time" methods whenever the
situation allowed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... This sound principle was the means of preventing
officers and men from degenerating into the "Ole Bill"
type&mdash;a type which probably existed nowhere except in
caricature. At Feuchy the Battalion was resting. The
enemy had been swept back and had left just a desolate
landscape, a smashed railway bridge and a collection of
shell holes. The accommodation for officers and men
consisted of holes in the ground roofed with tarpaulins
and cuttings in the embankment which carried what was
left of the railway line.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the entire lack of civilised comforts,
at 7.30 in the evenings, standing on the battered arch of
the bridge which once carried the line over Spider Corner,
a Battalion bugler would sound "Dress for Mess."
Officers would then scurry into their holes and half an hour
later emerge in slacks, well-groomed, and enter the mess,
a white-washed elephant shelter, and partake of a five-course
dinner with all customary mess etiquette.</p></div>

<p>On the 19th September the 168th Brigade returned to
the line. The Corps boundaries were being now rearranged
and the 56th Division was being side-stepped
to its right, a change which was effected by handing over
a portion of its left to the 4th Division and extending its
right over the front hitherto held by the 3rd Canadian
Division. The additional frontage on the right was allotted
to the 168th Brigade, which, after the relief, held a sector
east of Ecourt St Quentin, with the London Scottish on
the right and the 1/4th Londons on the left. The Brigade's
left flank was secured by the 167th Brigade, which, facing
north-east, held the area from Ecourt St Quentin to
Lécluse.</p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons' sector consisted of a line of outposts
some 500 yards west of the Canal du Nord, of which
both banks were held in force by the Germans, from the
Sauchy-Cauchy Road on the right, as far as Mill Copse
(inclusive to the enemy), where the line bent back and
facing north-east lay astride the Hirondelle River, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
village of Ecourt St Quentin being inclusive to us. This
line of outposts was held by two companies with Headquarters
in a cottage east of Osvillers Lake, while two
companies were in support in front of Rumaucourt.</p>

<p>The Battalion was unfortunate on the night of the
relief in losing 2/Lieut. A. Cartmell, wounded, while
2/Lieut. S. W. Neville was killed early the following
morning.</p>

<p>Like the Etaing area, this sector was marshy and intersected
in all directions by dykes and streams. On the
opposite bank of the Canal, the right flank around
Sauchy-Cauchy was equally swampy; but opposite the
centre and left the whole of our area was well under
observation from a considerable hill on which stood
Oisy-le-Verger&mdash;looking like a second Monchy&mdash;and the
Bois de Quesnoy.</p>

<p>In this sector the artillery on both sides was continually
active, though on the enemy's part activity was chiefly
confined to counter-battery work. The Battalion was
especially active at night in conducting reconnaissances of
the ground in front, and some useful information was
obtained. Very little was seen of the enemy's infantry,
though on two nights he succeeded by stealth in stealing
the garrison of one of our advanced posts, his second
attempt being rendered successful by the artifice of
approaching the post in the guise of deserters.</p>

<p>We must now turn for a moment to the general situation
and must briefly consider once more the results achieved
by the Battles of Bapaume and of the Scarpe in order to
appreciate the further development of the offensive.</p>

<p>In commenting on the achievements of the British
Armies in the Battle of Bapaume Sir Douglas Haig in his
despatches draws attention to the steady deterioration of
the enemy's morale and the increasing lack of organisation
in his defence:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The urgent needs of the moment, the wide extent of
front attacked and consequent uncertainty as to where
the next blow would fall, and the extent of his losses, had
forced the enemy to throw in his reserves piecemeal as they
arrived on the battle front. On many occasions in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
course of the fighting elements of the same German
division had been identified on widely separated parts
of the battle front.</p>

<p>In such circumstances a sudden and successful blow,
of weight sufficient to break through the northern hinge
of the defences on which he was to fall back, might produce
results of great importance.</p></div>

<p>This anticipation of the Commander-in-Chief was amply
fulfilled by the rapid retreat of the enemy towards the
Hindenburg line during the first week of September after
the close of the Battle of the Scarpe.</p>

<p>After hard fighting at Havrincourt and Epéhy during
the third week of September the enemy was definitely
within his Hindenburg defences as far north as Havrincourt,
north of which he had been pushed beyond them
to the line of the Canal du Nord. On the 12th September
the Americans drove the enemy out of the St Mihiel salient,
and it was decided in discussion between Sir Douglas Haig
and Marshal Foch that as soon as possible four vigorous
and simultaneous attacks should be launched: by the
Americans in the direction of Mézières; by the French in
Argonne with the same general objectives; by the British
in the direction of Maubeuge; and by Belgian and Allied
Forces in Flanders towards Ghent.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By these attacks, says Sir Douglas Haig, it was expected
that the important German forces opposite the French
and Americans would be pressed back upon the difficult
country of the Ardennes while the British thrust at their
main communications.</p></div>

<p>The long continued blows delivered by the British
Armies, although enormously successful, had placed a
great strain on the troops, and their losses, though small
in proportion to the enemy's and to the results achieved,
were in the aggregate considerable. The Hindenburg
positions were known to be strongly defended, and an
unsuccessful attack on them would have a serious political
effect and inevitably revive the declining German morale.
An important crisis in the War had been reached and it
was essential that the success of the British in this new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
attack should be decisive. After weighing the various
considerations involved Sir Douglas Haig states:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... I was convinced that the British attack was
the essential part of the general scheme and that the
moment was favourable. Accordingly I decided to proceed
with the attack....</p></div>

<p>The battle, which opened on the British front on the
27th September (Battle of Cambrai, 1918), culminated on
the 5th October in the capture of all the Hindenburg
trenches and of such isolated trench systems as lay in
rear of it.</p>

<p>The part of the 56th Division in this great battle was
the crossing of the Canal du Nord. This strong natural
obstacle was considered to be too stubbornly held to yield
to frontal attack on a wide area; and the general plan
was therefore for the Canadian Corps to cross it on a
narrow front north of Mœuvres and then spreading out
fanwise to extend the gains north and south on the east
bank.</p>

<p>The 1st Canadian Division, on the left of the Canadian
Corps and adjoining the right of the 56th Division, was to
cross the Canal south of the Arras-Cambrai Road and
carry the line forward to Haynecourt. After this the 56th
Division, astride the Canal on a front as far east as Sauchicourt
Farm, with the 11th Division on its right, would
attack northwards towards Oisy-le-Verger and the Sensée
River at Palluel.</p>

<p>The 56th Division attack was entrusted east of the
Canal to the 169th Brigade and west of it to the Kensingtons
of the 168th Brigade. The London Scottish and 1/4th
Londons in line had thus the peculiar experience of the
attack actually crossing their front from right to left.</p>

<p>At 5.30 a.m. on the 27th September the crash of the
barrage announced the opening of the Canadian Corps
attack. The enemy's retaliation was slight and had
practically ceased by 6 a.m. The 1/4th Londons' area
was occupied by eight brigades of field guns engaged in
firing a flank barrage to the main attack until 2.48 p.m.,
when they were to switch on a creeping barrage for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
attack northwards along the Canal. Additional flank
protection was furnished by six companies of machine-guns
also in our area. In view of this heavy barrage and
the possibility of severe retaliation the 1/4th Londons'
outpost line was thinned out to two platoons in charge of
Lieut. T. R. Fletcher, the remainder of the front companies
being withdrawn to the support position.</p>

<p>The Canadian attack went well, but very stiff opposition
was encountered in Marquion, so that the 56th Division
attack from the Blue line had to be postponed from
2.48 p.m. to 3.28 p.m. Excellent work was done by the
512th and 513th Field Companies, R.E. (56th Division),
in bridging the Canal at Marquion.</p>

<p>During the morning the 1/4th Londons' front seemed
to be clear, and an officer's patrol under 2/Lieut. O. C.
Hudson was sent forward to reconnoitre the enemy
positions along the Agache River, which were found to be
unoccupied.</p>

<p>At 3.28 p.m. the Kensingtons commenced their attack
and progressed without difficulty as far as their first
objective, the east and west road through Sauchy-Cauchy.
North of this, however, they were met with stubborn
resistance from machine-guns in Mill Copse and the marshes
east of the Canal. Owing to the restricted avenues of
advance through the marsh&mdash;there were only two possible
routes to Mill Copse&mdash;the Kensingtons' attack was checked
at about 6.30 p.m. some 500 yards south of the Copse.
Excellent information was brought to Headquarters by
2/Lieut. A. M. Bullock as to the situation not only of the
Kensingtons but also of the 169th Brigade east of the
Canal.</p>

<p>About 5.50 p.m. C and D Companies began to re-establish
the almost vacated outpost line, and later in the
evening D Company was ordered to endeavour to assist
the Kensingtons by pushing through to the Agache River
and if possible by working round the Copse. By shortly
after 11 p.m. reports were received that D Company had
established four posts in touch with the Kensingtons.
Mill Copse, however, was still in the enemy hands.</p>

<p>On the right of the Canal the 169th Brigade was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
held up by stubborn machine-guns, and it was not till
8 a.m. the following morning that they were fully in
possession of their final objective.</p>

<p>In view of the check on both banks the reserve company
of the Kensingtons was ordered to clear up the
situation as soon as the moon rose, and at 2 a.m. this
company advanced astride the Canal as far as Mill Copse,
which it found unoccupied. The Kensingtons then
organised in depth, having reached their final objective
at the surprisingly small cost of nine other ranks wounded.</p>

<p>The prosecution of the advance was ordered for the 28th
September, and the 1/4th Londons were detailed to carry
the 168th Brigade line forward on the west bank of the
Canal towards Palluel, while on the east the 169th Brigade
was to advance to the Sensée River.</p>

<p>During the night Battalion Headquarters was persistently
shelled from its left rear by guns across the
Sensée, with mustard gas.</p>

<p>At 9.30 a.m. D Company, with one platoon of A Company
attached, began the advance northward to Palluel
in the narrow gut of land between the Canal and the
marshes and ponds of the Hirondelle River. Lieut.-Col.
Marchment, 2/Lieut. Bullock, Sergts. Randall and Heyes
and a few signallers followed in the attack, communication
with Headquarters being maintained by a running wire
all the way. Very little opposition was met with, and
Capt. Cooper, with Lieut. Fletcher and 2/Lieut. Millstead,
was soon established on the bridges at Palluel, where
touch was gained with C Company and with patrols of
the 8th Middlesex (167th Brigade) which occupied the
village and advanced beyond it towards Arleux.</p>

<p>The whole 168th Brigade front being now confined to
this narrow tongue of land its area was handed over to
the 167th Brigade, and the 1/4th Londons withdrew to
reserve positions at Rumaucourt. This move was completed
by 9.15 p.m. on the 28th September.</p>

<p>This successful operation had been effected at very
slight loss, the total casualties of the Division having been
only 341 all ranks, while the 1/4th London losses for the
whole of September were the happily small total of 30<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
other ranks in addition to the two officers already mentioned.</p>

<p>During these two days' fighting the 11th Division on
the right had also met with considerable success, and on
the evening of the 30th September the 168th Brigade was
ordered back to the line to take over the positions gained
by the left Brigade (the 34th) of the 11th Division. The
advanced positions, which extended from the sharp bend
in the Sensée Canal south of Brunemont on the left to
a point opposite Aubencheul-au-Bac on the right, were
occupied by the London Scottish and the Kensingtons.</p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons, who marched from Rumaucourt
at 9 p.m. on the 30th September, relieved the 2nd Manchester
in the support area, on the high ground south
of Oisy-le-Verger and east of Sauchy-Lestrée.</p>

<p>The dispositions in this area were far from good, all
the companies being rather mixed up in the railway cutting
near the Bois des Puits; and on the following day Lieut.-Col.
Marchment effected a redistribution of the Battalion,
moving C and D Companies to Cemetery Wood and B
Company to Battalion Headquarters near the Aubencheul
Road, while A Company remained at the Bois des Puits.
For five days the Battalion was busily employed in nightly
working parties, digging a line of support posts across the
ridge south of Oisy-le-Verger as far east as the old German
dump at the cross-roads towards Epinoy. This dump
proved to be a rather popular spot for it was found
to be amply supplied with large bottles of Seltzer water.
Probably a good number of these was taken on unofficial
charge of the Battalion.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 5th October the 1/4th Londons
took over the right subsection from the London Scottish,
on the slope of the hill overlooking Aubencheul and the
railway triangle. Hostile activity was slight on the 6th
October, and from observation it seemed that the enemy
was holding Aubencheul very lightly; in the afternoon
orders were received to test the situation with patrols
and if possible to penetrate the village and occupy the
Canal bank north of it. Considerable fires observed
during the morning in Aubigny-au-Bac contributed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
the supposition that the vacation by the enemy of Aubencheul,
if not already accomplished, was at least imminent.</p>

<p>B Company (Lieut. H. F. Dade) was detailed for the
work, and at 7 p.m. No. 7 Platoon, with Lieut. A. M.
Bullock, Intelligence Officer, and 4 Headquarters scouts
attached, left advanced Battalion Headquarters to try to
enter the village and reach the railway bridge over the
Canal. The other platoons stood in readiness to move
forward if required. By 10.15 p.m. information was received
that the platoon was in the village without having
met with any of the enemy, and accordingly Nos. 5 and 8
Platoons were at once ordered to move forward to form
posts at the railway crossing and the Aubigny-au-Bac Road
bridge and to find touch with the 11th Division on the
right. These operations were successfully accomplished,
though the enemy gave evidence of his occupation of the
north end of the bridges.</p>

<p>By 4 a.m. on the 7th October the occupation of the
village was complete with two platoons which were in
touch with the 2nd Yorkshires (4th Division) on the right,
one platoon in the railway cutting south of the village and
one still in the old outpost line. No casualties had been
sustained.</p>

<p>The following day the 1/4th Londons took over the
whole Brigade front, C Company (Capt. C. L. Henstridge,
M.C.) on the right, A Company (Capt. L. L. Watts, M.M.)
in the centre and D Company (Lieut. T. R. Fletcher) on
the left. B Company (Lieut. H. F. Dade) was withdrawn
to support. The outposts consisted of a line of sentry
posts on the Canal with a line of resistance about 400
yards in rear. A reserve line was occupied on the spurs
overlooking the Canal north and east of Oisy-le-Verger.
Company Headquarters were located in captured German
battery positions, and D Company became the possessors
of a complete battery of 8-inch German howitzers which
had been taken on the 27th September.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span></p>

<p>The first phase of the great British offensive may now
be said to have been brought to a conclusion. In the
nine days' fighting between the 27th September and the
5th October, the First, Third and Fourth Armies had
shattered the enemy's last prepared lines of defence. The
line of the Canal du Nord had been crossed and left far
behind, and the whole of the main Hindenburg defences
were in our hands. "The effect of the victory," writes
Sir Douglas Haig in his despatches, "on the subsequent
course of the campaign was decisive." The threat to the
enemy's communications was now direct and instant, for
nothing but the natural obstacles of a wooded and well-watered
countryside lay between our Armies and Maubeuge.</p>

<p>In this fighting 30 British and 2 American infantry
divisions and 1 British cavalry division had met and defeated
39 German divisions at a loss to the enemy of 36,000
prisoners and 380 guns!</p>

<p>The effect of the advance of our Armies on this front
now rendered the enemy's positions in the Lys area
precarious. Already on the 28th September the Second
Army, attacking on a wide front about Ypres, had carried
forward our positions in one day a greater distance than
had been gained in the whole of the dreary struggles for
Passchendaele in 1917. By the 1st October Messines had
again been liberated and our troops were approaching
Gheluve and Werwicq. On the 2nd October the enemy
initiated a general withdrawal on the front from Lens to
Armentières.</p>

<p>We have now to follow the course of the second phase
of the British advance&mdash;the final phase of the War. In
this great operation the Fourth and Third Armies and the
right of the First Army advanced with their left flank on
the Canal from Cambrai to Mons and their right flank
covered by our French Allies.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first stage of this series of battles opened on the
8th October with a vast drive by the Third and Fourth
Armies in the direction of Le Cateau. The success of the
operation was complete, but we are only concerned with
the point that it involved the fall of Cambrai on the 9th
October.</p>

<p>This continued advance of the British in the south
exposed in increasing measure the flank of the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
north of the Sensée, and great developments were therefore
to be expected shortly in the XXII Corps area.
Already the enemy was reported to be withdrawing from
his positions in the corner between the Canal de la Sensée
and the Canal de l'Escaut, which had been crossed by the
Canadians as far north as Ramillies; and to relieve the
11th Division to pursue this movement the 168th Brigade
extended its right with the Kensingtons as far as Fressies,
which village was to be occupied immediately after the
completion of the relief. This was on the 9th October.</p>

<p>The possibility of an early German retirement north
of the Sensée also called for great vigilance, and the 1/4th
Londons were ordered to probe the situation towards
Brunemont and Aubigny-au-Bac, while units of the 167th
Brigade were feeling towards Arleux.</p>

<p>The only way to cross the Canal, short of swimming
or using a boat, was to use the ruined iron bridges at
Aubencheul and Abbaye-du-Verger Farm, and accordingly
small patrols, covered by parties on the south bank, began
to cross the bridges at about 5 p.m. on the 9th October.
Results were soon obtained. At Aubencheul the enemy
was alert and the patrol was driven back. At the Farm
crossing A Company obtained more success. A post of
the enemy about 12 strong was discovered on the Brunemont
Road north of the Canal, and these, after firing a few
shots, fled, though one of them was captured by Sergt.
R. C. Clammer, D.C.M., M.M., after which the patrol
returned. The prisoner was from the 103rd I Regiment,
and was a destitute wretch, wearing cap, jacket, trousers
and boots&mdash;and nothing else. Unfortunately, Capt. Watts
was killed by a stray bullet while returning to his company
headquarters.</p>

<p>The same evening the 1/4th Londons were relieved by
the 8th Middlesex (167th Brigade) and withdrew to Brigade
support in shelters west of Epinoy. At the same time the
Kensingtons and London Scottish effected the extension
to the right of the Divisional line above referred to.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 11th October the Kensingtons
launched a completely successful attack on
Fressies and advanced the Brigade line to the Canal at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
loss to themselves of only 10 casualties. In the meantime
the advance of the VIII Corps north of the Sensée River
had driven the enemy from Vitry-en-Artois and was now
being directed towards Douai. To assist in this development
the 56th Division artillery was ordered to keep under
fire the crossings over the northern arm of the Sensée Canal,
while the infantry made persistent endeavours to establish
themselves beyond the Canal de la Sensée with a view to
exerting pressure on the retiring enemy's left flank. On
the 12th the 167th Brigade completed the clearance of
Arleux which had been initiated by the Canadians, and
occupied the Canal triangle south-east of the village. The
following day the 169th Brigade occupied Aubigny-au-Bac
after a sharp fight, but a vigorous counter-attack later
threw them back to the Canal bank. In this fighting
magnificent devotion was displayed by the Royal Engineers
in bridging the Canal under heavy fire.</p>

<p>By the 16th October the 4th Canadian Division had
taken over the Divisional line and the 56th Division withdrew
into Army reserve.</p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons were relieved in the Brigade support
area by the 1/2nd Londons on the 11th October and passed
into Divisional reserve at Rumaucourt, where several days
of very welcome rest were obtained.</p>

<p>Both Rumaucourt and Ecourt-St Quentin were still
comparatively unharmed and partly furnished. Everywhere
were signs of the German occupation. The chief
anxiety of the enemy occupants seems to have been fear
of British aeroplanes, for every cellar had its capacity
plainly written on the door, while large warning bells or
"Flieger Alarum" were fixed in all prominent places. In
Ecourt-St Quentin were three German field hospitals
which afforded unmistakable evidence that the enemy
was hard up for bandages, for in place of these he seemed
to have used old curtains and paper. An abundant
quantity of old civilian clothing was also found here, and
rumour has it that the doctor was seen one day sporting an
excellent top hat. B Company lived in one of these
hospitals and had an excellent time with a grand piano.
These good Bosche institutions afforded an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
of bathing, of which advantage was taken by the whole
Battalion.</p>

<p>During the foregoing spell of active work the Battalion
transport had been located near Wancourt. "One day
in October," writes Lieut.-Col. Marchment, "a deputation
of Company Q.M.-Sergts. appeared at Orders with a request
that they might take it in turns to come up with the
rations, A and C one night, B and D the next. To this I
gladly consented when, looking at the map, I found that
they were walking and riding some twenty-six miles a
night!"</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 14th October the Battalion
marched to Marquion&mdash;till the 27th September in German
hands&mdash;to entrain for a rest at Arras. The train was due
out at 3 p.m., but as things turned out there was no occasion
for hurry, since owing to a smash at Boisleux the train did
not reach Marquion till 11 p.m. A weary but happy
Battalion entrained, confidently expecting to wake up in
Arras, but the advent of morning brought no change of
scene. The train had not moved an inch! However, in
due course the line was cleared and the train gaily rattled
over the battlefields of Quéant, Croisilles and Boyelles, and
reached Arras by 11.30 a.m. on the 15th. The 1/4th
Londons were quartered in comfortable billets in the Rue
d'Amiens.</p>

<p>The rest in Arras, with which charming little city
the Battalion had been so frequently associated, was
probably the most enjoyable that fell to its lot in the
whole War. To start with, everyone was in the highest
spirits born of the knowledge of their own recent successes
in action and of their confidence for the battles to come.
Food was good and plentiful. The civilians were returning
and shops were beginning to open once again.</p>

<p>Here the Battalion experienced the first visible effects
of what the liberation of France meant to the French.
Refugees from the liberated villages towards Cambrai
were being sent back for safety to Arras, where they were
housed in the Schramm Barracks till the French Mission
was able to arrange to settle them in other parts of France.
Streams of homeless women and children drifted through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
the streets, clinging to a few treasured objects of their
personal belongings, and our men stood at the street
corners deeply impressed by such heartrending scenes.
Shamefacedly, as if fearful of disclosing the depth of their
emotion to their comrades, the men would beg the refugees
to be allowed to carry their parcels for them. Three men
of one company took complete charge of a distressed
family and piloted them to a house where they settled
the poor folks, lit a fire for them, bought eggs with their
own money, scrounged some bully beef, and then fled to
avoid the thanks of their grateful charges.</p>

<p>The average Cockney is not in the habit of wearing his
heart on his sleeve. Rather does he conceal his emotion
beneath the cloak of "grousing," but scenes of desolation
such as these&mdash;far more affecting than the sight of a
ruined countryside&mdash;brought out all the wonderful chivalry
which has endeared the simple British soldier to the hearts
of the French. "It was only in censoring letters home,"
writes an officer, "that one realised how deeply touched
our men were by the sufferings of the civilians." Of all
these saddening sights probably the most dreadful was at
the Hôpital St Jean, where little mites of French children
were dying of gas poisoning, and old people lying demented
by the horrors through which they had passed. To
alleviate these sufferings everything possible was done, and
our own R.A.M.C. orderlies worked side by side with the
French Sisters of Mercy.</p>

<p>One afternoon the Commanding Officer gave permission
for the drums to play to the refugees. The performance
concluded with the Marseillaise, the glorious strains of
which, not heard for four long years, so overcame the
audience that in the intensity of their emotion old men,
women and children fell upon the drummers and kissed
them&mdash;much to the embarrassment of those good-natured
fellows.</p>

<p>Some excellent training meanwhile was being obtained
on the racecourse at Dainville, and several rifle competitions
were introduced to add to the keenness of the men.
The Battalion was largely reclothed and much done to
improve its excellent parade discipline. On the 21st<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
October a Guard of Honour was provided, consisting of
100 all ranks under Capt. H. N. Williams, M.C., for
President Poincaré, who was visiting Arras&mdash;"the finest
Guard the Division ever turned out," as Faulkner described
it. The identity of this distinguished visitor
remained for a long time shrouded in mystery, and curiosity
reached fever-pitch. The Mess decided that the only way
to deal with the problem was to have a sweepstake, in
which the names of the Prince of Wales, M. Clemenceau,
General Smuts, Marshal Foch and the Lord Nozoo (representing
The Field) were included. Captain Williams'
return was awaited with breathless anxiety, but, alas, in
the dark he had failed to solve the mystery. The Mess
paid out on M. Clemenceau&mdash;he being apparently the
nearest to the distinguished visitor who actually arrived.</p>

<p>During this rest at Arras the Battalion was joined by
Capts. H. W. Spiers and D. S. Boorman, M.C. (to command
B and C Companies respectively), and by Lieuts. E. G. Dew
and H. D. Rees, the latter being appointed Assistant-Adjutant.
Regimental Sergt.-Major Jacques, who was
returning to England in training for Quartermaster, was
replaced by Sergt.-Major Wilson, who had been wounded
at Ypres in 1917. The strength of the Battalion was now
38 officers and 721 other ranks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The latter half of October had seen most rapid and
important changes on the British battle front, to which
we must refer briefly. The success of the attack towards
Le Cateau in the early days of the month had been complete
and had driven the enemy back to the line of the
Selle River. This enabled G.H.Q. to initiate the second
stage of this last phase of the War, which was to force the
enemy from the Selle River back to the general line Sambre
Canal&mdash;western edge of Forêt de Mormal&mdash;Valenciennes.
The occupation of this line would enable the British Armies
to launch their final attack on Maubeuge.</p>

<p>The Battle of the Selle was opened by the Fourth Army
on the 17th October, the fight gradually involving the
Third and First Armies in succession. By the 20th October
the enemy had been driven across the Sambre as far north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
as Catillon, Le Cateau was occupied, and the Selle River
left two miles behind our advanced positions. The main
attack developed on the 23rd October, and by the end of
the following day the enemy was driven on to the western
edge of the Forêt de Mormal, the outskirts of Le Quesnoy
had been reached, and the lateral railway connecting Le
Quesnoy with Valenciennes had been crossed on a front
of about four miles. This latter portion of the success
was on the front of the XXII and Canadian Corps of the
First Army. The Selle River Battle resulted in the
capture of 20,000 prisoners and 475 guns, and in the defeat
of 31 German divisions by 25 British and 2 American
divisions.</p>

<p>On other parts of the front successes had been equally
striking. Laon had fallen to the French on the 13th
October. In Belgium, Menin, Thorout and Ostend had
been occupied in rapid succession, and by the 20th October
the Allied line rested on the Dutch frontier. This advance
in the extreme north had the effect of turning the defences
of Lille, which was encircled and occupied on the 18th
October, after which a steady advance brought our troops
to the line of the Scheldt north of Valenciennes to Avelghem.</p>

<p>The critical condition of the Germans is summed up by
Sir Douglas Haig in his despatches:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By this time the rapid succession of heavy blows dealt
by the British forces had had a cumulative effect, both
moral and material upon the German Armies.... His
reserves of men were exhausted.... The capitulation
of Turkey and Bulgaria and the imminent collapse of
Austria&mdash;consequent upon Allied successes which the
desperate position of her own armies in the western front
had rendered her powerless to prevent&mdash;had made
Germany's military situation impossible. If her armies
were now to be allowed to withdraw undisturbed to shorter
lines the struggle might still be protracted over the winter.
The British Armies, however, were now in a position to
prevent this by a direct attack upon a vital centre which
should anticipate the enemy withdrawal and force an
immediate conclusion.</p></div>

<p>A necessary preliminary to the final attack was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
capture of Valenciennes itself, and this was accomplished
on the 1st November. The XXII Corps, advancing on a
front of six miles to the south of the city, crossed the
Rhonelle River, and occupied the high ground overlooking
the valley of the Aunelle River, while the Canadians
entered Valenciennes and pushed on to the east of it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the 31st October the 56th Division rejoined the
XXII Corps in the battle area, and the battalions of the
168th Brigade embussed from Arras to Douchy (two miles
south of Denain). For a couple of days the 1/4th Londons
remained here in very fair billets, receiving a most hearty
welcome from the inhabitants, who had been for four years
under the heel of the enemy.</p>

<p>At 8 a.m. on the 2nd November the Battalion marched
about five miles forward to the staging area at Maing,
which it reached at about 11.30 a.m., and that evening
advanced again at short notice and relieved the 4th
K.O.Y.L.I. (49th Division) in advanced positions facing
Saultain, the relief being completed by 2 a.m. on the 3rd
November. The advance was led by D Company, which
came under heavy shell fire when passing through Famars,
and lost 4 men killed and 14 wounded.</p>

<p>The 168th Brigade section which was the left of the
Divisional front, the 169th being on the right, was held
with the Kensingtons and 1/4th Londons in the line. D
Company occupied small sections of trenches in the front
line some 500 yards west of the Château de Saultain,
while A, B and C Companies were held back in a sunken
road south-east of Aulnoy.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Col. Marchment was now in command of the
168th Brigade, General Loch having gone to hospital,
and the Battalion was temporarily under Major R. B.
Marshall, with Captain T. B. Cooper, M.C., M.M., acting
as second in command. Battalion Headquarters opened
in Aulnoy.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span></p>

<p>About the time of the relief it became apparent that
the enemy had retired again opposite the Canadians on
our left and was about to do so on our own front. At
10.35 a.m. a wire was received in the Battalion stating
that the Canadians had entered Estreux, and ordering
the Battalion to push strongly supported patrols through
Saultain as far as the Ferme du Moulin. D Company
moved forward at 11.15 a.m., supported by A Company,
and entered Saultain which was found to be unoccupied
except for four men of the 109th Infantry Regiment who
were taken prisoners. By two o'clock the Ferme du
Moulin was occupied with very little opposition and
Battalion Headquarters advanced to the Château de
Saultain. On the right the Kensingtons had also pressed
forward towards the cemetery of Curgies, and touch was
obtained with them and with the 4th Canadian Division
on the left. This advance&mdash;over 2000 yards&mdash;was consolidated
by the 1/4th Londons, while two squadrons of
Australian Light Horse and a company of New Zealand
cyclists endeavoured to push forward during the evening
to secure the crossings of the River Aunelle. Their
attempt, however, was checked about 1000 yards in
front of the infantry by enemy machine-gun fire, and in
this position the progress for the day was concluded, the
Kensingtons occupying with the cavalry and cyclists the
advanced line, which extended in a north-westerly direction
from the cross-roads at Le Talandier. That night the
1/4th Londons' position was held with D and A Companies
in front and B and C Companies in support.</p>

<p>The immediate resumption of the advance being
ordered by XXII Corps, arrangements were made by 56th
Division with the adjoining divisions to pursue the attack
at 6 a.m. the following morning, 4th November, each
division operating independently. Orders for this advance
did not reach the 1/4th Londons, who were detailed for the
attack on the 168th Brigade front, till 1 a.m., and there
was thus no more than enough time to assemble the companies
close in rear of the line held by the Kensingtons.
For reconnaissance there was no time at all. The attack
was delivered on a two-company front by B Company on
the right and A Company on the left, each moving in
square formation of platoons with a screen of scouts and
cavalry patrols in front. C and D Companies followed in
diamond formation at a distance of about 200 yards. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
objective was given as the high ground across the River
Aunelle about 500 yards east of Sebourquiaux.</p>

<p>The morning dawned mistily, but in this case the mist
was not altogether a disadvantage. The whole of this
countryside was a swelling waste of stubble fields with
practically no landmarks, but fortunately a line of telegraph
poles going due east which was visible through the mist
enabled the leading companies to keep their direction well&mdash;a
great stroke of luck, as the advance lay up hill and
down dale over this barren land for some 2000 yards
before the crest of the Aunelle Valley was reached, and
the objective was for a long time out of sight. The mist
thus served to conceal the advance from the enemy till
the leading companies breasted the hill overlooking
Sebourquiaux itself, and started descending the slope to
the village.</p>

<p>The Aunelle River is hereabouts spanned by three
bridges, one at Sebourg, one at Sebourquiaux, and one at
Le Pissot, north of the latter village. These had already
been secured by the cavalry patrols who had, however,
been unable to make progress across the river. As the
leading companies began to drop down the hill towards
the village the mist partly cleared, and the German
machine-gunners opened a heavy fire. The leading companies
at once dashed down the hill into the cover of the
scattered houses and streets which form the outskirts of
Sebourquiaux on the west bank of the river; but here
they seemed to have fallen into a trap for the enemy at
once dropped a barrage of considerable intensity, shells of
all calibres falling thick and fast. Forward progress was
impossible, and B Company on the right therefore promptly
worked round the right flank, crossing the river at Sebourg,
and then, turning northward toward Sebourquiaux,
cleared the village of the enemy machine-gunners. In
the meantime A Company had been heavily machine-gunned
from the direction of Rombies, which continued
to resist the Canadian attack, and touch with the Canadians
was lost.</p>

<p>B Company having cleared the way through the village,
A Company was able to cross the river, and together the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
two companies attempted to force their way up the slope
to the east of Sebourquiaux. The machine-gun fire was
too intense, and the companies had to fall back to a line on
the eastern outskirts of the village, where, joined by C
Company (in support), they began to consolidate their
position. Touch was obtained with the Queen's Westminsters
of the 169th Brigade who had cleared Sebourg
on the right, but no connection could be obtained with the
Canadians who were still held up before Rombies on the
left, and A Company therefore threw a defensive flank
astride the Aunelle River facing northwards. The Battalion
was now organised on the line which had been gained, all
companies having platoons on the forward positions and
finding their own supports. All day the village of Sebourquiaux
remained under heavy German shell fire, but at
about 5.30 p.m. the intensity of the enemy's fire increased
and the work of destruction was completed, hardly a
house being left standing. A variegated display of Véry
lights which accompanied this barrage led to the expectation
that the enemy was organising a counter-attack,
but no infantry movement on the part of the Germans
materialised.</p>

<p>The stiffness of the enemy resistance this day made it
abundantly clear that further progress could be made only
by means of an organised attack in co-operation with the
divisions on either flank, and arrangements for a further
advance were promptly made.</p>

<p>That night the 1/4th Londons were relieved by the
London Scottish and withdrew in Brigade reserve to the
high ground east of Estreux, Headquarters remaining at
the Ferme du Moulin. This relief was completed at 3 a.m.
on the 5th November, and at 5.30 a.m. the attack was
pursued by the London Scottish, with the Kensingtons in
support and the 1/4th Londons in reserve. By 6 a.m.
the crest east of Sebourquiaux had been gained and the
enemy was retiring in the direction of Angre.</p>

<p>On the 169th Brigade front the enemy resistance was
not severe, and by 7.30 a.m. the London Rifle Brigade had
captured Angreau. The Canadians had also occupied
Rombies, but on the ridge between this village and Angre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
the Germans continued to hold out in great force and to
bring very heavy machine-gun fire to bear on the left flank
of the 168th Brigade.</p>

<p>At 8 a.m. the 1/4th Londons were ordered forward, and
by 11 a.m. the companies, A, B, C and D in line from
right to left, were in position in the old German trenches
east of Sebourquiaux, with Battalion Headquarters
in a farmhouse in the village. In this position the
Battalion was practically on the frontier of France and
Belgium.</p>

<p>The advance was resumed by the London Scottish
under a barrage at 4.15 p.m., and the line was advanced
to within about 500 yards of Angre. The enemy machine-gun
fire again precluded the possibility of further advance,
and eventually a line was consolidated facing north-east
in touch with the 169th Brigade on the right and the
Canadians on the left.</p>

<p>On the 6th November the attack was pursued by the
London Scottish on the right and the Kensingtons on the
left, the 1/4th Londons again being in support. Fierce
fighting took place, particularly on the left flank where
the Kensingtons crossed the Grande Honnelle River, were
thrown back, and crossed it again. At the end of the day
the leading battalions were in possession of Angre, on the
east bank of the Grand Honnelle. The 1/4th Londons
moved forward slightly from their positions of the previous
day but did not come into action.</p>

<p>The whole of these days were extremely wet, and not a
man in the Battalion had a scrap of dry clothing. Trenches
were embryonic, and shelters almost entirely lacking&mdash;of
dugouts there were, of course, none.</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight "Drake" Battalion of the
63rd (Royal Naval) Division relieved the Battalion&mdash;the
remainder of the Brigade also being relieved&mdash;and it
withdrew to tolerable billets in Sebourg. The march to
Sebourg was only about two miles, but every road was
choked with double and even treble lines of transport of
all descriptions waiting to follow up the advance. It had
been waiting motionless since the previous afternoon and
did not get on the move again till 4 a.m. the next morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
In these circumstances the march to Sebourg occupied
about four hours&mdash;a most unpleasant journey in which
desultory shelling by the enemy alternated with heated
arguments with despairing transport officers. Dawn,
however, found the Battalion enjoying a good breakfast,
and drying its clothes, all its troubles forgotten, and
every one filled with justifiable satisfaction at the good
work that had been done.</p>

<p>This, the last fight of the 1/4th Londons, produced
nine prisoners and cost in casualties: 2/Lieut. A. M.
Bullock, killed; 2/Lieut. G. H. Sylvester, died of wounds;
2/Lieut. H. W. Taylor, wounded; and in N.C.O.'s and
men, 11 killed, 55 wounded and 1 missing.</p>

<p>From now onwards the 56th Division was fighting on
a one-brigade front, with the 167th leading, and the 1/4th
Londons were engaged in following up the advance by
stages so as to be within supporting distance of the leading
troops. Nowhere was the enemy's opposition more than
trifling, and the advance proceeded rapidly, though under
conditions of some discomfort and difficulty. The line of
the Division's advance lay almost due east, roughly
parallel to the marshes about the Canal de Condé which
connects the Canal de l'Escaut with Mons, and the whole
countryside is cut up by innumerable small streams discharging
northwards into the marsh area. The banks of
these streams are everywhere steep, and bridges had been
systematically destroyed by the retiring enemy who had
also blown craters at almost every road junction. It was
an ideal country for a determined enemy to fight a rearguard
action, but the Germans' powers of resistance were
broken, and beyond the delays caused to the progress of
our troops by the wholesale destruction, opposition was
negligible. The extreme rapidity of the advance indeed
made it almost impossible for the supply services to keep
pace, and the damage to the roads prevented lorries from
proceeding beyond the Grande Honnelle River till the
necessary repairs could be completed. The weather,
moreover, had broken, and for three days rain fell incessantly.
But these discomforts were slight in comparison
with the enormous wave of enthusiasm which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
passed over all the troops who had the good fortune to
take part in this extraordinary victory.</p>

<p>On the 7th November the line of the Bavai-Hensies
Road was crossed, and the following day the leading
troops had reached the line Petit Moronfait-Rinchon-Ferlibray.
The 9th November saw the Mons-Maubeuge
Road crossed, and on the 10th the 1st Londons, who were
leading, captured Harveng, and after slight opposition
pushed forward to Harmignies.</p>

<p>The 1/4th Londons following up the advance moved
on the 8th to Autreppe and the following day to Blaugies.
The band was now with the Battalion and played on the
march. This gave rise to most remarkable patriotic
demonstrations on the part of the liberated villagers who
everywhere greeted the Battalion with cries of "Vive
l'Angleterre!" and showered flowers on the troops, while
crowds of children marched beside the band cheering. The
plight of these poor people was deplorable. The Germans
in their retirement had taken with them practically all
food supplies and utensils of every description. Scarcely
the bare necessities of life remained. All live stock had
also been driven before them by the retreating hordes of
the enemy, but when the Battalion reached Blaugies the
presence of live stock in the village showed the ever-increasing
confusion and speed of the enemy's retirement.
At this time the Division was feeding some 16,000 civilians,
on an allowance of one iron ration to four people.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 10th November the 1/4th
Londons continued their almost triumphal progress to
La Dessoue, but there being no accommodation here, found
billets in Sars-la-Bruyère, where an overwhelming welcome
was accorded them. In this village Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien
(II Corps) had had his Headquarters on the 23rd
August 1914.</p>

<p>The Brigade Ammunition Column at this time was in
charge of Lieut. E. P. M. Mosely, whose diary illustrates
the extraordinary spirit of humour which carried the men
through this period of hard work and exposure. The
Column reached Famars thoroughly tired out one wet
night at about midnight, and halted in rear of the advancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
troops. The civilians had been evacuated and the men
rapidly made themselves comfortable in some of the
cottages. One of the transport drivers, according to the
immemorial custom of transport drivers, quickly began
to forage round, and attired himself in a top hat, white
scarf and frock coat, in which remarkable garb he put his
head round the door and said: "I've come for the rent!"
This, after a hard night's work, shows a spirit which takes
a lot of damping.</p>

<p>It was in this advance also that the Column arrived in
a battered village late at night, thoroughly worn out and
drenched to the skin. The place was muddy, shell torn
and desolate, and its exact whereabouts on the map far
from certain. The men began to picket their horses and
spread tarpaulins over their heaped-up stores, and afterwards
disconsolately to search for odd bits of timber in
the endeavour to construct some sort of shelter. The O.C.
Column produced from a waggon an antique arm-chair,
which had somehow attached itself to the Column at an
earlier stage of the advance, and in this very much improvised
headquarters took up his station in the mud, when
suddenly&mdash;the post arrived! The Army Postal Service had
throughout been so efficient as to become almost a matter
of course&mdash;but in this effort it surely surpassed itself!</p>

<p>On the night of the 10th November the 56th Division
was relieved by the 63rd Division by whom the advance
was to be pursued; but early the following morning the
news of the Armistice was received and the troops stood
fast. The record of this grand culmination of the years
of bloodshed is contained in the Battalion Official War
Diary as follows:</p>

<p>The vast Forêt de Mormal had been passed, Mons and
Maubeuge had fallen, and the German Army was divided
into two parts, one on each side of the natural barrier of
the Ardennes.</p>

<p>In his Despatches Sir Douglas Haig sums up the situation
on the morning of the 11th November 1918 thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the fighting since November 1st, our troops had
broken the enemy's resistance beyond hope of recovery,
and had forced on him a disorderly retreat along the
whole front of the British Armies. Thereafter the enemy
was capable neither of accepting nor refusing battle....
The strategic plan of the Allies had been realised with a
completeness rarely seen in war. When the Armistice
was signed by the enemy his defensive powers had already
been definitely destroyed. A continuance of hostilities
could only have meant disaster to the German Armies and
the armed invasion of Germany.</p></div>

<p>A remarkable incident related by Lieut. Mosely occurred
at Sars-la-Bruyère the day following the Armistice.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Mess Corporal proceeded to Mons to see if any
green vegetables could be procured. Returning from his
mission through the streets of Mons he saw a soldier
untidily dressed and without puttees, but wearing on his
jacket the red circles which were the distinguishing mark
of the 1/4th Londons. Said the Corporal, "What are you
doing here?" "Looking for my Battalion," replied the
man. The Corporal demanded to know why the man
had wandered so far from billets and what he meant by
being so untidily turned out. To his surprise the soldier
informed him that he had come from Germany. A few
more words and the Corporal realised that this was one
of our own men who had walked out of a German prison
when the Armistice was declared. Whipping up the
wanderer into the Mess cart, he brought him home, washed
him and gave him a big meal. The poor fellow was
almost hysterical at being amongst his own once more.
He was a man of B Company who had been captured
on the 28th March 1918, at Oppy. "We gave him a
strong dose of rum," writes Mosely, "and wrapped him
in warm blankets. By the next morning he had quite
recovered, and was asking for his pay!"</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus ended the four years' war service of the 1/4th
Londons, who at the end of the campaign were within
two miles of Malplaquet, where Marlborough's great
victory had been won two hundred years earlier. It had
the proud distinction of having finished its active service
within five miles of Mons, where the first British shot
had been fired in August 1914. Of the 1016 officers
and men who had left England on the 4th September
1914, only about 30 other ranks remained with the
Battalion which had done such glorious service on so
many hard-fought fields.</p>

<p>As a tribute to the many unrewarded acts of heroism
of which there have been so many examples during the
War, a letter, relating to the circumstances attending the
death of No. 280872 Pte. S. Greenfield of D Company on
the 23rd August 1918, is preserved among the Battalion
records. This letter was sent by the Medical Officer,
178th Brigade, R.F.A., who found Greenfield's body, to
his relatives, from whom it was received by the Commanding
Officer. The following is an extract from this
letter, which is dated 24th August 1918:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... On searching the battlefield (Boyelles) I discovered
the body of your son Private S. Greenfield, No. 280872.
He had died fighting, killed outright by a machine-gun.
I found him lying on a German machine-gun which I
have no doubt he intended to capture. As no more
dead were there and no other signs of a fight about the
machine-gun nest, I expect he rushed the machine-gunners
himself. I may remark the machine-gunners are dead
also.</p></div>

<p>One of the survivors of the original Battalion was
Flossie, a small, brown Pomeranian dog. Flossie had served
on the railway line in August 1914, had accompanied the
Battalion to Malta and been successfully smuggled into
France in January 1915. Throughout the War she had
journeyed everywhere with the Battalion, and finally
came home with the Cadre in 1919. Her principal claim
to distinction appears to be that she succeeded in bringing
a litter of puppies into a noisy and muddy world in most
of the leading towns and villages of Flanders. Throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
she maintained a calm demeanour, and when her maternal
cares necessitated transport she rode with her young
family in a basket perched on one of the cookers.</p>

<p>On the 15th November a party of the Battalion,
under Capt. H. N. Williams, M.C., took part in the
triumphal march through Mons, where the troops were
received with a tumultuous welcome.</p>

<p>There is little further to be said. The XXII Corps
was excluded from the Army of the Rhine and the Battalion
remained in the Mons area, training and indulging in
educational experiments, while parties visited the battlefields
of Mons and Waterloo. Until the ravages of
demobilisation reduced the numbers too severely, the
evenings were enlightened by some of the Quartermaster's
excellent orchestral concerts, and by boxing tournaments
in which the Battalion did exceedingly well, Private
Miller of the 1/4th Londons becoming XXII Corps
Feather-weight Champion.</p>

<p>On the 27th November the Battalion moved to billets
in Villers-sire-Nicole, near Maubeuge, and on the 6th
March 1919 to Givry and on the 18th March to Cuesmes
(both near Mons), in all of which places the routine of
training and education was continued. Early in the New
Year the arrangements for demobilisation were put into
active operation, and rapidly the strength of the Battalion
dwindled.</p>

<p>Among the first to leave was the padre, Rev. S. F.
Leighton Green, M.C., who had served continuously with
the Battalion since December 1916. The padre left on
the 13th February 1919, and his departure was felt most
keenly by every officer and man in the Battalion. His
constant selfless devotion to duty and his kindly personality
had made him a true friend to one and all, and the example
of his simple life and magnificent courage in action had
been a real inspiration to all&mdash;and that included the whole
Battalion&mdash;who had been brought into personal contact
with him.</p>

<p>The break-up of the Battalion was the saddest thing
which ever happened to it. After so many months and
years of good and bad times, and of life in circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
of such intimacy as can be attained only on active service,
the joy of departure for home was severely tempered by
the deepest emotion at leaving the comradeship of
regimental life, and few said good-bye to the Battalion
without genuine sorrow.</p>

<p>By the beginning of May the Battalion was reduced to
Cadre strength, about 50 all ranks, Lieut.-Col. Marchment,
D.S.O., M.C., remaining in command, with Major T. B.
Cooper, M.C., M.M., second in command.</p>

<p>On the 14th May 1919 the Cadre left Cuesmes, entraining
at Jemappes for Antwerp. After a few days in the embarkation
camp it was played down to the quay by the
pipes of the Liverpool Scottish and embarked for Tilbury,
where it entrained for Newhaven. On the 21st May the
Cadre returned to London by train and was received at
London Bridge Station by the Lord Mayor (the Rt. Hon.
Sir Horace Marshall, now Lord Marshall of Chipstead,
P.C., K.C.V.O., Hon. Colonel of the Regiment), who also
took the salute as the Cadre passed the Mansion House
<i lang="fr">en route</i> for Headquarters in Hoxton.</p>

<p>The Cadre was received at Headquarters by Lieut.-Col.
H. Dade, V.D., Major G. H. M. Vine, T.D., and other
officers of the Regiment, and by the Mayor of Shoreditch
(Councillor W. Girling), after which its dispersal speedily
followed.</p>

<p>Three weeks later the last remnants of the 1/4th
Londons were scattered to their homes, and the part
played by the Regiment in the Great War was at an
end.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX I<br />

MALTA</h2>


<p>The Dependency of Malta consists of a chain of islands, Gozo,
Comino and Malta, stretching from north-west to south-east,
about 60 miles from Sicily and about 180 from Africa. Malta
itself is about 17½ miles long and 8¼ broad, and, owing to its
magnificent natural harbours, it has been the coveted possession
of the strongest nations on the sea for the time being, ever
since the dawn of maritime trade. These anchorages are nearly
all on the east coast of the island, and include&mdash;besides the
famous harbours of Valetta (the Grand Harbour on the south
of the city and the Marsamuscetto Harbour on the north)&mdash;the
bays of Melleha, St Paul's and Marsa Scirocco.</p>

<p>The population of Malta in 1907 was 206,690, and this
phenomenal congestion renders it largely dependent on imported
foodstuffs. The area under cultivation is comparatively small,
and the fields are composed of terraces by which the soil with
enormous labour has been walled up along the contours of
the hills to prevent it from being washed away. Viewed from
the sea, therefore, the top of one wall appearing above the next
produces the barren effect to which reference has been made
in Chapter II; but the aspect of the land from the top of the
hills in winter and early spring is a beautiful contrast of a
profusion of greenness. The principal grain crops are maize,
wheat and barley. Vines are also cultivated though the fruit
is sold as grapes far more profitably than converted into wine.
The chief industry is the production of Maltese lace, which
employs some 5000 women and children. The principal
resources of the island are derived from the fact of its being
an important military station and the Headquarters of the
Mediterranean fleet, the prolonged absence of which always
produces distress.</p>

<p>The Maltese language is Phœnician in origin, the popular
idea that it is composed largely of Arabic being erroneous.
Until recent years the language of the courts was Italian, in
spite of the fact that this language is unknown to 86 per cent,
of the population.</p>

<p>Malta has had a most chequered history from the earliest times
when the Mediterranean was the centre of all civilisation and
commerce. The Phœnicians occupied the islands at a very
early date, being followed in the 6th century B.C. by the Carthaginians,
and later by the Romans, who regarded the Maltese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
not as conquered enemies but as allies. On the final division
of the Roman Dominions in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 395, Malta was assigned to
the Empire of Constantinople, and during the next 500 years
suffered three Arab invasions, though these left little mark
upon the people either by language or by inter-marriage.
In 1090 the Counts of Normandy captured the island and
finally expelled the Arabs, retaining possession until 1265,
when it passed into the hands of the Aragonese, Kings of Sicily.</p>

<p>It was in 1530 that the most interesting period of Maltese
history commenced, for in that year the islands were granted
by the Emperor Charles V to the Knights of St John, who had
been expelled from Rhodes by the Turks; and some thirty
years later the Knights of the Order and the Christian Maltese
combined under de Valette, the Grand Master, whose name
survives in the town of Valetta, in resisting the last effort of
the Mohammedan power to gain the ascendancy in the
Mediterranean. The Siege of Malta, which was most gallantly
resisted by the Knights, proved successful, and they remained,
although <i lang="la">de jure</i> owing allegiance to Sicily, <i lang="la">de facto</i> masters of
Malta, until they were finally expelled in 1798 by the French
under Napoleon, who used the island as a base for his disastrous
expedition to Egypt in that year.</p>

<p>The staunch allegiance of the Maltese to the Church of
Rome soon brought them into conflict with the French, whose
plundering of the churches provoked a revolution in which the
Maltese invoked the aid of Nelson. The Treaty of Amiens,
1802, provided for the return of the island to the Knights of
Malta, but the Maltese, realising that this would entail a revival
of French influence, protested vigorously, with the result that
in 1814 the Treaty of Paris finally secured Malta to the British
Empire. Since this date the story of Malta has on the whole
been one of advancement in every direction.</p>

<p>The chief towns of the island are Valetta, the seat of government,
and Citta Vecchia (otherwise known as Notabile or
Medina), the ancient capital and stronghold; other places of
importance being Musta, Birchircara and Attard&mdash;all of which
will be well remembered by all ranks of the Regiment.</p>

<p>The head of the Government and Commander-in-Chief and
Governor-General was in 1914 General Sir Leslie Rundle,
G.C.B., G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O., D.S.O.</p>

<p>The garrison consisted of three battalions of British Infantry,
two companies of Fortress Engineers, together with detachments
of Royal Garrison Artillery, Royal Army Medical Corps,
Royal Army Service Corps, and in addition two battalions of
Malta Militia (Infantry), and the Malta Artillery.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX III<br />

THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE <span class="smcap">4TH</span> LONDON REGIMENT IN 1920</h2>


<p>After the return to England of the Cadres early in 1919,
the Territorial Force remained in abeyance for the remainder
of the year, and beyond the formation of an Old Comrades'
Association, under the Presidency of Lieut.-Col. Harry Dade,
V.D., nothing could be done in the 4th Londons to maintain
<i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> at the high standard which it had reached
during the War.</p>

<p>When orders were issued early in 1920 for the reconstruction
of the auxiliary forces under the title of the Territorial Army,
the effect of eight months' inactivity became painfully apparent,
and the 4th London Regiment, which was revived in February
1920, experienced, in common with most other units, great
difficulty in recruiting, owing to the rapidly cooling enthusiasm
of the greater number of its former members. By great good
fortune a large number of old officers returned to the Colours,
and command was given to Lieut.-Col. L. T. Burnett, O.B.E.,
T.D., while Major H. J. Duncan-Teape, T.D., was appointed
Second in Command, and Captain W. A. Trasenster, M.C., The
Royal Fusiliers, Adjutant. The Company Commanders and
Headquarters Officers were:&mdash;</p>

<p>With this excellent stiffening the Battalion soon began to
make progress, and rapidly took&mdash;and held&mdash;the lead in
numbers in the 1st London Brigade.</p>

<p>The first Annual Training was held at Shoreham-by-Sea,
the time being devoted principally to musketry and recreational
training. For the first time in the Battalion's history, the
winter following was marked by the continuance without a
break of the drill season; and throughout the winter of 1920-21
attendances at the weekly drills at Headquarters reached an
unusually high percentage of the strength. The Battalion
appeared to be well on its feet, and making steady progress
towards efficiency, when, in April 1921, the Coal Strike completely
dashed all hopes of a successful summer training season.
The Territorial Army was temporarily in abeyance, and for
three months its headquarters were handed over to the Defence
Force, to which was entrusted the maintenance of peaceful
conditions throughout the country.</p>

<p>A Defence Force Unit was raised at the 4th Londons' Headquarters,
and joined by some of the members of the Battalion,
command of it being taken by Major R. N. Arthur, with the
acting rank of Lieut.-Col. The disbandment of the Defence
Force was fortunately effected in time to enable the Annual
Training to be held at Shorncliffe in August, but the serious
delay already caused to the individual training of the men
rendered it less valuable than had been hoped; and a far
too great proportion of the training hours had to be spent on the
range, in the Musketry Practices, which should have been
completed early in the year.</p>

<p>During the spring of 1921 the Battalion suffered a severe loss
in the death, after a prolonged and painful illness, of the Quartermaster,
Lieut. E. S. Tomsett, to whose invaluable services
reference has been made in the preceding pages. After Lieut.
Tomsett's death, Regtl. Q.M.-Sergt. M. Harris was gazetted
Lieut. and Quartermaster.</p>

<p>The beginnings of the 4th London Regiment in the revived
Territorial Army have been small, but every step has been made
secure by careful organisation, and by applying the experience
of Territorial soldiering in peace and war; and there is every
reason to suppose that the laurels gained by the Regiment in
the Campaigns in which it has taken part will remain untarnished,
and that its glorious traditions will be jealously
guarded as long as the Regiment remains in existence.</p>
